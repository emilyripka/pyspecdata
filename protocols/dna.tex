Here, we are looking at the DNP on CS14, which Katherine looked at before.
This is the part that has the ligand, but is not bound to streptavidin.

\subsubsection{Quick ESR in probe}\maxminutes{11}
Put into tune mode, $40\;dB$ first.

Insert probe, and turn up air to 12~SCFH (since a new sample, just use a higher flow rate).

Move to near 9.77 and autotune.

\paragraph{determine ratio}
\ntd{I don't have git set up right here, but later, I should paste the ratio procedure here}
\subsubsection{DNP Experimental Setup}

\paragraph{tune NMR, when I'm not using microwave power}
Set switch to DNP amp, set bridge to standby.

Attach probe w/ coil perpendicular to $B_0$ + at correct height, then turn on air (14~SCFM).

Turn on $B_0$ field.

Make a new NMR experiment based on template, and change into that experiment.

\texttt{wobb}. \adlin{back moves lf/right front moves down/up}

\texttt{gs} and field sweep $B_0$ over about 0.1~G until 0 (set center field, then copy to static field, then back to time scan).

Check that the YIG's DC power supply reads 0.26-0.27~A with first light on and other lights green.

\paragraph{tune and set resonant field}
Attach probe w/ coil perpendicular to $B_0$ + at correct height, then turn on air (20~SCFM).

Put into tune mode before inserting sample, and turn down power.

Move to near 9.77 and autotune + turn on $B_0$ field.

Make a new NMR experiment based on template, and change into that experiment.

\fn{dopc_984mM_120503}
\texttt{wobb}. \adlin{back moves lf/right front moves down/up}

Check the ESR tune by hand up to 0~dB and record microwave frequency.
\begin{python}[off]
calcfielddata(9.790094,'mtsl','cnsi')
\end{python}
Put ESR bridge in standby mode and disconnect the mod coil.

Set the field to a reasonable value (last value usually fine, if not use the value from the ratio).

Use \texttt{jf\_setmw} to set frequency ratio and YIG frequency.
Check that the YIG's DC power supply reads 0.26-0.27~A with first light on and other lights green.

\texttt{jf\_zg} for signal about 15 high, then set it on resonance (lightning bolt o1).

Set sfo1 to (ppt value)*(YIG frequency), then use jf\_setmw to center resonance in gs.

\paragraph{calibrate 90 time and $T_1$}

Run \texttt{jf_zg}; zoom in; \texttt{dpl1}; then \texttt{paropt} with \texttt{p1},8,1,3 which gives signal at 8\us, 9\us, and 10\us pulse length, which should be $\approx 360^o$.

Flip the waveguide switch so the amp is connected (not the bridge).

If needed, run a rough experiment to determine the $T_1$ time, and put it in experiment 101.

\sout{ Wobb + just set sfo1 to bottom of dip. }
sfo1 to 1.51671*frequency, regardless of exact nucleus.
wobb + tune NMR.

Tune EPR.

Unclick g=2, and set mod amp high so I can get signal in a signal shot.

Re-run EPR zoomed in to center peak.

Turn modulation amp down to 1.5~G, and let it run a few averages.

Set offset based on high and low peaks.

Set field to zero-crossing of center peak on EPR.

Set EPR to standby.

jf\_zg.

Set sfo1 to resonance.

Increase aq to 2.0.

Set \texttt{aq} back to 0.5.

\paragraph{Tune and set resonant field}
Detach mod coil and hang in the plastic loop (here so that I don't potentially mess up microwave tune later!).

Copy nmr template dataset.
\fn{dna_cs14_bound_120314}

Overwrite exp 1 with desired parameters.
\fn{dna_cs14_rerun_120314}

Round nearest 0.0005\GHz to get YIG frequency.

Open first experiment and set NMR sfo1 to (1.5167)*(YIG frequency).

Tune NMR with {\tt wobb}.

\precaution{Run jf\_dnpconf if necessary -- specifically may need to decrease my attenuation settings by 2.7 $dB$ (or just round it to 3 $dB$).}

Tune microwave by hand
{\small (Simultaneously set:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bias (diode centered at 50 $dB$)
    \item frequency (AFC)

\end{itemize}
up to 5 $dB$.)}
\begin{lstlisting}

Check that YIG frequency is still good

EPR to standby.

\precaution{If frequency is really different for some reason, I will have to set the field here to the value given above.}

\paragraph{ Match NMR + YIG frequencies}
jf\_zg $\Rightarrow$ for 3.5 $\mu L$ sample, peak should 10-15 high.

Check that the source is on, and reads 0.26 $A$ (rather than 0.54 $A$).

Click lightning bolt to set o1 (while zoomed in with top window).

Repeat jf\_zg to verify that field has stabilized (peak should be at 0).

Set YIG frequency.

Be sure the ppt value is set to the value above.

\precaution{Test amp switch with jf\_setmw (leave other parameters as default).}
Iteratively adjust the field.
{\small
\begin{enumerate}
	\item jf\_setmw (31.5 $dB$, YIG frequency),
	\item then if field offset is significant, adjust $B_0$, otherwise stop
	\item jf\_zgm
	\item then set sfo1 to NMR resonance (lightning bolt) + start over
\end{enumerate}
}

\paragraph{90 time and ready amp}
jf\_zg + zoom + dpl1 + run {\tt paropt} (p1,8,1,3)

\precaution{This should go down to up at the full cycle;
if problems, (p1,1,1,11).}
\precaution{If you want to decrease the narrow noise spikes, minimize WinEPR + turn off bridge + put all bridge cables on top of dewar while paropt is running; could be obsolete with box?}
Flip waveguide switch.

Set + record $t_{90}$ (``\texttt{p1}'')=(length of full cycle [\us])/4 (At this point, you've determined the resonance frequency, resonant field, and $t_{90}$).
