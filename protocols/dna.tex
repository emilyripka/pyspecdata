\timeblocktotal{3.6}
Here, we are looking at the DNP on CS14, which Katherine looked at before.
This is the part that has the ligand, but is not bound to streptavidin.

\subsubsection{initial setup}\maxminutes{57}
\paragraph{before leaving}
Be sure to carry over:
\begin{itemize}
    \item microcentrifuge tubes
    \item toolbox 
    \item multimeter 
    \item samples (leave in my box in CNSI fridge)
    \item magnifying glasses
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{always}
Be sure to change section title and label!!!

Copy section label to list for the day.

\paragraph{capillary prep}
\subparagraph{using the sealed tubes from Yuan}
Cut tube with a few mm space for critoseal.

Measure sample.

Insert in probe.

Check probe marker marks.

Put into tune mode before inserting sample, and turn down power.

Put stuff back in fridge!

\subsubsection{Quick ESR in probe}\maxminutes{11}
Put into tune mode, $40\;dB$ first.

Insert probe, and turn up air to 12~SCFH (since a new sample, just use a higher flow rate).

Move to near 9.77 and autotune.

\paragraph{test for signal}
try same parameters as her.

try to increase the modulation amplitude, just to see signal.

zoom in and repeat.

check for saturation 15, down by 3~dB.

save saturated scan.
\fn{dna_cs14_overmod_sat_120314}

use a power slightly before saturation.

Make an experiment with this power, but turn down the modulation amplitude and change the receiver window and the resolution and number of scans.

Increase the modulation amplitude to 2~G.

\paragraph{actual ESR}
Turn on field.

Copy experiment.
\fn{dna_cs14_overmod_120314}

\paragraph{always}
Run actual scan.

Save ESR.
\fn{dna_cs14_bound_overmod_120314}

Cntrl-S after scan is finished.

Hit Cntrl-A for ssh transfer and process.

\subsubsection{set up DNP}\maxminutes{38}

\paragraph{insert probe and autotune}

Turn off field.

Check marker marks on probe.

Insert probe with sample.

Attach tuning box, then position and tighted screw.

Turn up air to 10 SCFH.

Press autotune.

\paragraph{determine ratio (if desired)}

\subparagraph{determine experimentally}
Re-run ESR with probe.

Copy template.
\fn{dna_cs14_120314}

\sout{ Wobb + just set sfo1 to bottom of dip. }
sfo1 to 1.51671*frequency, regardless of exact nucleus.
wobb + tune NMR.

Tune EPR.

Unclick g=2, and set mod amp high so I can get signal in a signal shot.

Re-run EPR zoomed in to center peak.

Turn modulation amp down to 1.5~G, and let it run a few averages.

Set offset based on high and low peaks.

Set field to zero-crossing of center peak on EPR.

Set EPR to standby.

jf\_zg.

Set sfo1 to resonance.

Increase aq to 2.0.  

Unplug mod coil.

jf\_zg and lightning bolt for o1.  

jf\_zg to check.

Copy microwave frequency from ESR and sfo1 from center frequency.  


\begin{lstlisting}
microwave_frequency = 9.790412 #(from file)
field = 3488.9
nmr_frequency = 14.8505980

calcfielddata(microwave_frequency,chemical,'cnsi')
\end{lstlisting}

Set \texttt{aq} back to 0.5.

\paragraph{Tune and set resonant field}
Detach mod coil and hang in the plastic loop (here so that I don't potentially mess up microwave tune later!).

Copy nmr template dataset.
\fn{dna_cs14_bound_120314}

Overwrite exp 1 with desired parameters.
\fn{dna_cs14_rerun_120314}

Round nearest 0.0005\GHz to get YIG frequency.

Open first experiment and set NMR sfo1 to (1.5167)*(YIG frequency).

Tune NMR with {\tt wobb}.

\precaution{Run jf\_dnpconf if necessary -- specifically may need to decrease my attenuation settings by 2.7 $dB$ (or just round it to 3 $dB$).}

Tune microwave by hand
{\small (Simultaneously set:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bias (diode centered at 50 $dB$)
    \item frequency (AFC)
    \item phase (coarse: dip in tune mode; fine: furthest right diode w.r.t.signal phase while AFC remains locked)
\end{itemize}
up to 5 $dB$.)}
\begin{lstlisting}
calcfielddata(9.790400,'R5a','cnsi')
\end{lstlisting}

Check that YIG frequency is still good

EPR to standby.

\precaution{If frequency is really different for some reason, I will have to set the field here to the value given above.}

\paragraph{ Match NMR + YIG frequencies}
jf\_zg $\Rightarrow$ for 3.5 $\mu L$ sample, peak should 10-15 high.

Check that the source is on, and reads 0.26 $A$ (rather than 0.54 $A$).

Click lightning bolt to set o1 (while zoomed in with top window).

Repeat jf\_zg to verify that field has stabilized (peak should be at 0).

Set YIG frequency.

Be sure the ppt value is set to the value above.

\precaution{Test amp switch with jf\_setmw (leave other parameters as default).}
Iteratively adjust the field.
{\small
\begin{enumerate}
	\item jf\_setmw (31.5 $dB$, YIG frequency),
	\item then if field offset is significant, adjust $B_0$, otherwise stop
	\item jf\_zgm
	\item then set sfo1 to NMR resonance (lightning bolt) + start over
\end{enumerate}
}

\paragraph{90 time and ready amp}
jf\_zg + zoom + dpl1 + run {\tt paropt} (p1,8,1,3)

\precaution{This should go down to up at the full cycle;
if problems, (p1,1,1,11).}
\precaution{If you want to decrease the narrow noise spikes, minimize WinEPR + turn off bridge + put all bridge cables on top of dewar while paropt is running; could be obsolete with box?}
Flip waveguide switch.

Set + record $t_{90}$ (``\texttt{p1}'')=(length of full cycle [\us])/4 (At this point, you've determined the resonance frequency, resonant field, and $t_{90}$).

\paragraph{determine $T_1(t)$}
Use jf\_dnp to determine number of points for a scan 17~min long:
bound NL $\Rightarrow$ min of 2.5 max of 2.9
unbound NL $\Rightarrow$ min of 2.0 max of 2.9

Set 20 experiments for 4:40, exp 4$\Rightarrow$ 101.

\paragraph{run DNP}
Start jf\_dnp: Set minimum and maximum $T_1$ values based on $T_1$ estimate (with heating).
Bound CS14 $\Rightarrow$ min 1.5, max 2.3
Unbound CS14 $\Rightarrow$ min 1.7, max 2.6

Set number of $T_1$ time to 17~min for this sample.

Set watch timer for experiment time.

\subsubsection{ESR}\maxminutes{11}

(Here, I run ESR after the DNP, so I don't have to worry about timing, but still get the double integral)
Put into tune mode, $40\;dB$ first.

Load sample in the teflon sample holder (I want ~77 $mm$ from collet to bottom of sample, need to remeasure) -- weight the top with the collet holder.

If not exactly the same type of sample, test run to check some stuff.

\precaution{Only if the experiment says ``uncalibrated'' at the top $\Rightarrow$ ``I'' (interactive spectrometer control) icon, click calibrated, then set parameters to spectrum, then window.}

\paragraph{if new type of sample}
Stop at second peak.

Check that modulation amplitude is $<$ 0.2 x smallest feature.

Set RG with box.

Check that resolution along $x$ is OK.

\paragraph{always}

Run actual scan.
