abstract = {Nanocapsules were synthesized using the droplets of an oil-in-water microemulsion as a template. Et butyrate was solubilized in normal saline using Tween-80, lecithin, and n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane as surfactants. A polysiloxane/silicate shell was formed at the surface of the mixed surfactant layer by crosslinking n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane and tetramethoxysilane. The shell stabilized the oil droplets against coalescence as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the samples immediately following the synthesis and months afterward. The diam. of nanocapsules can be controlled by using different component ratios, as measured by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) and TEM. The efficacy of nanocapsules to sequester hydrophobic compds. made by using different formulations was studied by UV-visible spectrometry. The results showed that nanocapsules with smaller diams. are generally more efficient in the uptake process than larger ones. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {CW-EPR studies of NO adsorbed on sodium ion-exchanged zeolites were focused on the geometrical structure of NO monoradical and (NO)2 biradical formed on zeolites. The EPR spectrum of NO monoradical adsorbed on zeolite can be characterized by the three different g-tensor components and the resolved y-component hyperfine coupling with the 14N nucleus. Among the g-tensor components, the value of gzz is very sensitive to the local environment of zeolite and becomes a measure of the electrostatic field in zeolite. The temperature dependence of the g-tensor demonstrated the presence of two states of the Na-NO adduct, in rigid and rotational states. The EPR spectra of NO adsorbed on alkaline metal ion-exchanged zeolite and their temperature dependency are essentially the same as that on sodium ion-exchanged zeolite. On the other hand, for NO adsorbed on copper ion-exchanged zeolite it is known that the magnetic interaction between NO molecule and paramagnetic copper ion are observable in the spectra recorded at low temperature. The signals assigned to (NO)2 biradical were detected for EPR spectrum of NO adsorbed on Na-LTA. CW-EPR spectra as well as their theoretical calculation suggested that the two NO molecules are aligned along their N---O bond axes. A new procedure for automatical EPR simulation is described which makes it possible to analyze EPR spectrum easily. In the last part of this paper, some instances when other nitrogen oxides were used as a probe molecule to characterize the zeolite structure, chemical properties of zeolites, and dynamics of small molecules were described on the basis of selected literature data reported recently.},

abstract = {The cooperative nature of protein substructure and internal motion is a critical aspect of their functional competence about which little is known experimentally. NMR relaxation is used here to monitor the effects of high pressure on fast internal motion in the protein ubiquitin. In contrast to the main chain, the motions of the methyl-bearing side chains have a large and variable pressure dependence. Within the core, this pressure sensitivity correlates with the magnitude of motion at ambient pressure. Spatial clustering of the dynamic response to applied hydrostatic pressure is also seen, indicating localized cooperativity of motion on the sub-nanosecond time scale and suggesting regions of variable compressibility. These and other features indicate that the native ensemble contains a significant fraction of members with characteristics ascribed to the recently postulated "dry molten globule". The accompanying variable side-chain conformational entropy helps complete our view of the thermodynamic architecture underlying protein stability, folding, and function.},

This method, in combination with DNA content analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), was applied to the synchronized cell culture of a CDC28-13th mutant (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In synchronous cell growth, relative permittivity epsilon (or dielectric constant) for the culture broth showed cyclic changes at low frequencies below 0.5 MHz, being correlated to phases in the cell cycle that were simultaneously determined by FACS. The epsilon increased in the period from S phase to G(2) phase and decreased between M and G(1) phases. Peaks in these cyclic changes of epsilon indicated the time when daughter cells segregated from mother cells.},

abstract = {Most biologically relevant environments involve highly concentrated macromolecular solutions and most biological processes involve macromolecules that diffuse and interact with other macromolecules. Macromolecular crowding is a general phenomenon that strongly affects the transport properties of macromolecules (rotational and translational diffusion) as well as the position of their equilibria. NMR methods can provide information on molecular interactions, as well as on translational and rotational diffusion. In fact, rotational diffusion, through its determinant role in NMR relaxation, places a practical limit on the systems that can be studied by NMR. While in dilute solutions of non-aggregating macromolecules this limit is set by macromolecular size, in crowded solutions excluded volume effects can have a strong effect on the observed diffusion rates. Hydrodynamic theory offers some insight into the magnitude of crowding effects on NMR observable parameters.},

High resolution transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy techniques are used to observe the variation in size, structure and oxidation state, respectively as a function of time. The morphology variation and the hierarchical assembly (octahedral superstructure) of nanostructures are imputed to the inherent structural aspects of cerium oxide. It is hypothesized that the 3-5 nm individual building blocks will undergo an intra-agglomerate re-orientation to attain the low energy configuration.

Its application for NMR sensitivity enhancement has been limited because of intrinsic and experimental problems to apply this method at high magnetic fields. Here we report on 95 GHz DNP experiments using the common TEMPO radical dissolved in water. In an efficient non-radiative microwave resonator, we observe average experimental enhancement factors up to -65. The local enhancement in the center of the resonator is calculated to reach a level of -94 at the highest microwave power. At high microwave power, the DNP enhancement shows a linear increase with no tendency to saturation. The results indicate that a substantial sensitivity enhancement is possible for liquid state NMR in nL sample volumes.},

The temp. dependence of the TEMPO parameter was measured.

In the temp. region of the main transition, the TEMPO parameter increased rapidly, then gradually with increasing temp., which could be explained by the eutectic phase diagram. The rotational correlation time of a spin probe 16-doxylstearic acid and the order parameter of 5-doxylstearic acid in the aq. dispersion system of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine revealed that the motion of the alkyl chain in the liq. crystal state was hindered in the center of the membrane as well as near the surface by the adsorption of (+)-catechin.

Normally, in most organic radical solutions the dynamic enhancements of solvent proton resonances decay with increasing field and decreasing temperature due to the dipole-dipole intermolecular interactions, modulated by translational diffusion of individual molecules. In contrast to free radical, a strong solvation effect has been discovered in paramagnetic Cr5+ compounds. Drastic departures from the usual DNP behaviour have been observed. An explanation of the observed effects is proposed by considering the occurrence of hydrogen-bridged solvates. The important motional mechanism that modulates the proton-electron interaction switches from translation to rotation of the complex molecules. A new type of pulse double resonance equipment is used.},

abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization is emerging as a potential tool to increase the sensitivity of NMR aiming at the detection of macromolecules in liquid solution. One possibility for such an experimental design is to perform the polarization step between electrons and nuclei at low magnetic fields and then transfer the sample to a higher field for NMR detection. In this case, an independent optimization of the polarizer and detection set ups is required. In the present paper we describe the optimization of a polarizer set up at 15 MHz (1)H NMR/9.7 GHz EPR frequencies based on commercial hardware. The sample consists of the nitroxide radical TEMPONE-D,(15)N in water, for which the dimensions were systematically decreased to fit the homogeneous B(1) region of a dielectric ENDOR resonator. With an available B(1) microwave field up to 13 G we observe a maximum DNP enhancement of -170 at room temperature by irradiating on either one of the EPR lines. The DNP enhancement was saturated at all polarizer concentrations. Pulsed ELDOR experiments revealed that the saturation level of the two hyperfine lines is such that the DNP enhancements are well consistent with the coupling factors derived from NMRD data. By raising the polarizing field and frequencies 10-fold, i.e. to 140 MHz (1)H/94 GHz EPR, we reach an enhancement of -43 at microwave field strengths (B(1) approximately 5 G). The results are discussed in view of an application for a DNP spectrometer.},

abstract = {A novel fast and quiet method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is introduced which creates new opportunities for imaging in medicine and materials science. The method is called SWIFT, sweep imaging with Fourier transformation. In SWIFT, time-domain signals are acquired in a time-shared manner during a swept radiofrequency excitation of the nuclear spins. With negligible time between excitation and signal acquisition, new possibilities exist for imaging objects consisting of spins with extremely fast transverse relaxation rates, such as macromolecules, semi-solids, and quadrupolar nuclei. The field gradient used for spatial-encoding is not pulsed on and off, but rather is stepped in orientation in an incremental manner, which results in low acoustic noise. This unique acquisition method is expected to be relatively insensitive to sample motion, which is important for imaging live objects. Additionally, the frequency-swept excitation distributes the signal energy in time and thus dynamic range requirements for proper signal digitization are reduced compared with conventional MRI. For demonstration, images of a plastic object and cortical bone are shown.},

abstract = {Biology relies on functional interplay of proteins in the crowded and heterogeneous environment inside cells, and functional protein interactions are often weak and transient. Thus, methods that preserve these interactions and provide information about them are needed. In-cell nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive method for studying a protein's behavior in cells because it may provide residue-level structural and dynamic information, yet several factors limit the feasibility of protein NMR spectroscopy in cells; among them, slow rotational diffusion has emerged as the most important. In this paper, we seek to elucidate the causes of the dramatically slow protein tumbling in cells and in so doing to gain insight into how the intracellular viscosity and weak, transient interactions modulate protein mobility. To address these questions, we characterized the rotational diffusion of three model globular proteins in Escherichia coli cells using two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. These proteins have a similar molecular size and globular fold but very different surface properties, and indeed, they show very different rotational diffusion in the E. coli intracellular environment. Our data are consistent with an intracellular viscosity approximately 8 times that of water, too low to be a limiting factor for observation of small globular proteins by in-cell NMR spectroscopy. Thus, we conclude that transient interactions with cytoplasmic components significantly and differentially affect the mobility of proteins and therefore their NMR detectability. Moreover, we suggest that an intricate interplay of total protein charge and hydrophobic interactions plays a key role in regulating these weak intermolecular interactions in cells.},

abstract = {Electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy of phospholipids spin-labeled systematically down the sn-2 chain was used to detect the penetration of water (D2O) into bilayer membranes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine with and without 50 mol \% cholesterol. Three-pulse stimulated echoes allow the resolution of two superimposed 2H-ESEEM spectral components of different widths, for spin labels located in the upper part of the lipid chains. Quantum chemical calculations (DFT) and ESEEM simulations assign the broad spectral component to one or two D2O molecules that are directly hydrogen bonded to the N-O group of the spin label. Classical ESEEM simulations establish that the narrow spectral component arises from nonbonded water (D2O) molecules that are free in the hydrocarbon chain region of the bilayer membrane. The amplitudes of the broad 2H-ESEEM spectral component correlate directly with those of the narrow component for spin labels at different positions down the lipid chain, reflecting the local H-bonding equilibria. The D2O-ESEEM amplitudes decrease with position down the chain toward the bilayer center, displaying a sigmoidal dependence on position that is characteristic of transmembrane polarity profiles established by other less direct spin-labeling methods. The midpoint of the sigmoidal profile is shifted toward the membrane center for membranes without cholesterol, relative to those with cholesterol, and the D2O-ESEEM amplitude in the outer regions of the chain is greater in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence. For both membrane types, the D2O amplitude is almost vanishingly small at the bilayer center. The water-penetration profiles reverse correlate with the lipid-chain packing density, as reflected by 1H-ESEEM intensities from protons of the membrane matrix. An analysis of the H-bonding equilibria provides essential information on the binding of water molecules to H-bond acceptors within the hydrophobic interior of membranes. For membranes containing cholesterol, approximately 40\% of the nitroxides in the region adjacent to the lipid headgroups are H bonded to water, of which ca. 15\% are doubly H bonded. Corresponding H-bonded populations in membranes without cholesterol are ca. 20\%, of which ca. 6\% are doubly bonded.},

abstract = {The first steps of the photocycle of the D97N mutant of proteorhodopsin (PR) have been investigated by means of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. A comparison with the primary dynamics of native PR and D85N mutant of bacteriorhodopsin is given. Upon photoexcitation of the covalently bound all-trans retinal the excited state decays biexponentially with time constants of 1.4 and 20 ps via a conical intersection, resulting in a 13-cis isomerized retinal. Neither of the two-deactivation channels is significantly preferred. The dynamics is slowed down in comparison with native PR at pH 9 and reaction rates are even lower than for native PR at pH 6, where the primary proton acceptor (Asp97) is protonated. Therefore, the ultrafast isomerization is not only controlled by the charge distribution within the retinal binding pocket. This study shows that in addition to direct electrostatics other effects have to be taken into account to explain the catalytic function of Asp97 in PR on the ultrafast isomerization reaction. This may include sterical interactions and/or bound water molecules within the retinal binding pocket.},

abstract = {The radiowave dielectric properties of aqueous heterogeneous systems during the complexation of charged polyions and oppositely charged liposomal particles have been measured in a wide frequency range, between 100 Hz and 2 GHz. The formation of a polyion-liposome complex driven by the correlated polyion adsorption at the particle surface implies two concomitant effects referred to as reentrant condensation and charge inversion. Both of them are governed by electrostatic interactions and there is now strong evidence, based on experiments and simulations, that counterion release is the driving force of the aggregation process. From this point of view, dielectric technique may offer a suitable tool in the investigation of the structural properties of these aggregates. In spite of the fact that interaction of polyions with oppositely charged surfaces was extensively experimentally investigated, there are no papers concerning the dielectric properties during the polyion-induced aggregation. To get an insight into this important topic, the authors present here an extensive set of radiowave dielectric measurements of liposomal vesicle aqueous suspensions where the liposome aggregation was induced by an oppositely charged polyion. The aggregation was followed from the beginning, when most of the isolated liposomes predominate, up to the formation of polyion-coated liposomes of inverted charge, crossing the isoelectric condition, where large, almost neutral, aggregates appear. The authors describe the observed dielectric dispersions as due to counterion polarization in the adjacency of the liposome and liposome aggregate surface, primarily governed by the zeta potential, according to the standard electrokinetic model.},

By comparing results from the free duplex with those from its complex with netropsin, water molecules in the "spine of hydration" in the AATT region of the minor groove could be distinguished from hydration water elsewhere in the duplex. The 2H and 17O relaxation dispersions yield a model-independent residence time of 0.9(+/-0.1) ns at 4 degrees C for five highly ordered water molecules in the spine. When corrected for frequency offset effects, the NOE data yield the same residence time as the NMRD data, giving credence to both methods. At 27 degrees C, the residence time is estimated to 0.2 ns, a factor of 40 shorter than the tumbling time of the duplex. The NMRD data show that all water molecules associated with the duplex, except the five molecules in the spine, have residence times significantly shorter than 1 ns at 4 degrees C. There is thus no long-lived hydration structure associated with the phosphate backbone. In contrast to 2H and 17O, the 1H relaxation dispersion is dominated by labile DNA protons and therefore provides little information about DNA hydration.},

However, solution neutron and X-ray diffraction indicate that even di- and tri-valent ions do not significantly alter the density or orientation of water more than two water molecules (5 A) away. Therefore the long range electric fields (generated by simple ions) which can be detected by various resonance techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer over distances of 30 A (about 11 water diameters) or more must be weak relative to the strength of water-water interactions. Two different techniques indicate that the interaction of water with anions is by an approximately linear hydrogen bond, suggesting that the dominant forces on ions in water are short range forces of a chemical nature.},

abstract = {Recent achievements in liquid state DNP at high magnetic fields showing significant enhancements on aqueous solutions have initiated strong interest in possible applications of this method to biomolecular research. However, in situ DNP of biomolecules at ambient temperatures is a challenging task due to high microwave losses leading to excessive sample heating. To avoid such heating the sample volume has to be reduced strongly to keep it away from the electric component of the microwave field. A helical double resonance structure, used for the first demonstrations of the applicability of Overhauser DNP to aqueous solutions at high magnetic fields (9.2 T), restricted the sample size to a very small volume of 2 nl. Together with a poor spectral resolution this resulted in small overall signal amplitude, hampering observations of biomolecules. Here we present a new type of the double resonance structure for liquid-state DNP which consists of a Fabry-Perot resonator for the microwave excitation and a stripline resonator for the NMR detection. This new double resonance structure (260 GHz/400 MHz) offers a 30-fold increase in aqueous sample volume (80 nl) with respect to the helical probe and exhibits improved NMR sensitivity and linewidth.},

Based on these parameters, all other associated gate and trigger timings are internally generated automatically without the need to enter them explicitly. The excitation pulse widths were of nanosecond resolution while all other gate pulses can be incremented in steps of 20 ns without compromising spectrometer performance.

A simple proportionality relation between geminate CIDNP of a nucleus and its HFCC at the radical stage is established. The applicability range of this relation is determined: the relation is fulfilled in the case of a large difference in g-factor between the radicals involved and for the situation where the number of magnetic nuclei in the system is sufficiently large. The validity of the relation was confirmed by CIDNP experiments on radical pairs with precisely known HFCCs. Using the proportionality relation we were able to measure the HFCCs in various short-lived radicals of the amino acids histidine and tryptophan and of the S-N-centered cyclic radical of methionine derived from the methionine-glycine dipeptide in aqueous solution.},

abstract = {Advanced MRI techniques, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion MR imaging can give important in vivo physiological and metabolic information, complementing morphologic findings from conventional MRI in the clinical setting. Combining perfusion MRI and MR spectroscopy can help in patients with brain masses in who the pre-operative differential diagnosis is unclear. This review demonstrates the use of dynamic, susceptibility weighted, contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DSC MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to distinguish surgical from non-surgical lesions in the brain. There is overlap in the MRI appearance of many enhancing and ring-enhancing lesions such as gliomas, metastases, inflammatory lesions, demyelinating lesions, subacute ischemia, abscess and some AIDS related lesions. We review examples of histopathologically confirmed high-grade glioma, a middle cerebral artery territory infarct, a tumefactive demyelinating lesion and a metastasis for which conventional MR imaging (MRI) was non-specific and potentially misleading and demonstrate how DSC MRI and MRSI features were used to increase the specificity of neurodiagnosis. At several institutions, many patients routinely undergo MRI as well as MRSI and DSC MRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements are obtained from regions of maximal perfusion as determined from perfusion color overlay maps. Metabolite levels and ratios are determined for Choline (Cho), N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA), Lactate and Lipids (LL). Metabolite levels are obtained by measuring the peak heights of each metabolite and the ratios are obtained from these measurements for Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr. Neurosurgical intervention carries substantial morbidity, mortality, financial and potential emotional cost to the patient and family. Making a pre-operative diagnosis allows the neurosurgeon to be confident in the choice of treatment plan for the patient and allays considerable patient anxiety. The utility of combining clinical findings with multi-parametric information from perfusion and spectroscopic MR imaging in differentiating surgical lesions from those which do not require surgical intervention is discussed.

abstract = {The importance of membrane-based compartmentalization in eukaryotic cell function has become broadly appreciated, and a number of studies indicate that these eukaryotic cell membranes contain coexisting liquid-ordered (L(o)) and liquid-disordered (L(d)) lipid domains. However, the current evidence for such phase separation is indirect, and so far there has been no direct demonstration of differences in the ordering and dynamics for the lipids in these two types of regions or their relative amounts in the plasma membranes of live cells. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the presence of two different types of lipid populations in the plasma membranes of live cells from four different cell lines by electron spin resonance. Analysis of the electron spin resonance spectra recorded over a range of temperatures, from 5 to 37 degrees C, shows that the spin-labeled phospholipids incorporated experience two types of environments, L(o) and L(d), with distinct order parameters and rotational diffusion coefficients but with some differences among the four cell lines. These results suggest that coexistence of lipid domains that differ significantly in their dynamic order in the plasma membrane is a general phenomenon. The L(o) region is found to be a major component in contrast to a model in which small liquid-ordered lipid rafts exist in a 'sea' of disordered lipids. The results on ordering and dynamics for the live cells are also compared with those from model membranes exhibiting coexisting L(o) and L(d) phases.},

abstract = {Amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers, also known as poloxamers, have broad biomembrane activities. To illustrate the nature of these activities, (1)H Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy was employed to sensitively detect polymer-lipid membrane interactions through the modulation of local hydration dynamics in lipid membranes. Our study shows P188, the most hydrophilic poloxamer that is a known membrane sealant, weakly adsorbs on the membrane surface, yet effectively retards membrane hydration dynamics. Contrarily, P181, the most hydrophobic poloxamer that is a known membrane permeabilizer, initially embeds at lipid headgroups and enhances intrabilayer water diffusivity. Unprecedented resolution for differentiating weak surface adsorption versus translocation of polymers to membranes is obtained by probing local water diffusivity in lipid bilayer systems. Our results illustrate that the relative hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of the polymer dictates its functions. These findings gleaned from local hydration dynamics are well supported by a thermodynamics study presented in the accompanying paper (Wang, J.-Y.; Marks, J. M.; Lee, K. Y. C.

@article{Franck2009,
abstract = {Portable NMR systems generally suffer from poor field homogeneity and are therefore used more commonly for imaging and relaxation measurements rather than for spectroscopy. In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to increase the sample volume that is usable for spectroscopy. These include approaches based on manual shimming and those based on clever combinations of modulated radio frequency and gradient fields. However, this volume remains small and, therefore, of limited utility. We present improved pulses designed to correct for inhomogeneous dispersion across wide ranges of frequency offsets without eliminating chemical shift or spatial encoding. This method, based on the adiabatic double passage, combines the relatively larger corrections available from spatially matched rf gradients [C. Meriles et al., J. Magn. Reson. 164, 177 (2003)]. with the adjustable corrections available from time-modulated static field gradients [D. Topgaard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 17576 (2004)]. We explain the origins of these corrections with a theoretical model that simplifies and expedites the design of the pulse waveforms. We also present a generalized method for evaluating and comparing pulses designed for inhomogeneity correction. Experiments validate this method and support simulations that offer new possibilities for significantly enhanced performance in portable environments.},

abstract = {The interactions and processes which structure prokaryotic cytoplasm (water, ions, metabolites, and biomacromolecules) and ensure the fidelity of the cell cycle are reviewed from a physicochemical perspective. Recent spectroscopic and biological evidence shows that water has no active structuring role in the cytoplasm, an unnecessary notion still entertained in the literature; water acts only as a normal solvent and biochemical reactant. Subcellular structuring arises from localizations and interactions of biomacromolecules and from the growth and modifications of their surfaces by catalytic reactions. Biomacromolecular crowding is a fundamental physicochemical characteristic of cells in vivo. Though some biochemical and physiological effects of crowding (excluded volume effect) have been documented, crowding assays with polyglycols, dextrans, etc., do not properly mimic the compositional variety of biomacromolecules in vivo. In vitro crowding assays are now being designed with proteins, which better reflect biomacromolecular environments in vivo, allowing for hydrophobic bonding and screened electrostatic interactions. I elaborate further the concept of complex vectorial biochemistry, where crowded biomacromolecules structure the cytosol into electrolyte pathways and nanopools that electrochemically "wire" the cell. Noncovalent attractions between biomacromolecules transiently supercrowd biomacromolecules into vectorial, semiconducting multiplexes with a high (35 to 95\%)-volume fraction of biomacromolecules; consequently, reservoirs of less crowded cytosol appear in order to maintain the experimental average crowding of ∼25\% volume fraction. This nonuniform crowding model allows for fast diffusion of biomacromolecules in the uncrowded cytosolic reservoirs, while the supercrowded vectorial multiplexes conserve the remarkable repeatability of the cell cycle by preventing confusing cross talk of concurrent biochemical reactions.},

abstract = {Frequency-swept pulses are not typically employed to excite spins in NMR. When used for selective excitation in MRI, such pulses do not produce a proper echo because the phase of the transverse magnetization varies in a quadratic manner across the slice or slab. Previously, frequency-swept pulses such as the chirp pulse have been shown to offer an approach to reduce the peak radiofrequency power required for excitation. It has also been shown that chirp excitation produces a unique type of echo (dubbed "pseudo-echo" here) and images can be generated from the resultant pseudo-echoes using a quadratic reconstruction method (J.G. Pipe, Magn Reson Med 1995;33:24-33). The present work describes a general theory and methods for exciting spins with other types of frequency-swept pulses (HSn pulses), which offer the advantage of delivering better excitation profiles than the chirp pulse. Here, pseudo-echoes are produced with HSn pulses in conventional gradient-echo 3D MRI, and high-quality images are reconstructed using standard fast Fourier transformation. An optional apodization procedure using a sliding window function is also introduced. When the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter is limiting, signal-to-noise ratio of pseudo-echo imaging is superior to that obtained with standard excitations.},

abstract = {We introduce a newly developed tool, (1)H Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP), to sensitively explore weak macromolecular interactions by site-specifically probing the modulation of the translational dynamics of hydration water at the interaction interface, in the full presence of bulk water. Here, ODNP is employed on an illustrative example of a membrane-active triblock copolymer, poloxamer 188 (P188), which is known to restore the integrity of structurally compromised cell membranes. We observe a distinct change in the translational dynamics of the hydration layer interacting with the lipid membrane surface and the bilayer-interior as P188 is added to a solution of lipid vesicles, but no measurable changes in the dynamics or structure of the lipid membranes. This study shows that hydration water is an integral constituent of a lipid membrane system, and demonstrates for the first time that the modulation of its translational diffusivity can sensitively report on weak polymer-membrane interactions, as well as mediate essential lipid membrane functions. ODNP holds much promise as a unique tool to unravel molecular interactions at interfaces even in the presence of bulk water under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Membrane-active peptides participate in many cellular processes, and therefore knowledge of their mode of interaction with phospholipids is essential for understanding their biological function. Here we present a new methodology based on electron spin-echo envelope modulation to probe, at a relatively high resolution, the location of membrane-bound lytic peptides and to study their effect on the water concentration profile of the membrane. As a first example, we determined the location of the N-terminus of two membrane-active amphipathic peptides, the 26-mer bee venom melittin and a de novo designed 15-mer D,L-amino acid amphipathic peptide (5D-L9K6C), both of which are antimicrobial and bind and act similarly on negatively charged membranes. A nitroxide spin label was introduced to the N-terminus of the peptides and measurements were performed either in H2O solutions with deuterated model membranes or in D2O solutions with nondeuterated model membranes. The lipids used were dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), (DPPC/PG (7:3 w/w)), egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PG (PC/PG (7:3 w/w)), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PG (PE/PG, 7:3w/w). The modulation induced by the 2H nuclei was determined and compared with a series of controls that produced a reference "ruler". Actual estimated distances were obtained from a quantitative analysis of the modulation depth based on a simple model of an electron spin situated at a certain distance from the bottom of a layer with homogeneously distributed deuterium nuclei. The N-terminus of both peptides was found to be in the solvent layer in both the DPPC/PG and PC/PG membranes. For PE/PG, a further displacement into the solvent was observed. The addition of the peptides was found to change the water distribution in the membrane, making it "flatter" and increasing the penetration depth into the hydrophobic region.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential components of cellular signaling pathways. They are the targets of many current pharmaceuticals and are postulated to dimerize or oligomerize in cellular membranes in conjunction with their functional mechanisms. We demonstrate using fluorescence resonance energy transfer how association of rhodopsin occurs by long-range lipid-protein interactions due to geometrical forces, yielding greater receptor crowding. Constitutive association of rhodopsin is promoted by a reduction in membrane thickness (hydrophobic mismatch), but also by an increase in protein/lipid molar ratio, showing the importance of interactions extending well beyond a single annulus of boundary lipids. The fluorescence data correlate with the pK(a) for the MI-to-MII transition of rhodopsin, where deprotonation of the retinylidene Schiff base occurs in conjunction with helical movements leading to activation of the photoreceptor. A more dispersed membrane environment optimizes formation of the MII conformation that results in visual function. A flexible surface model explains both the dispersal and activation of rhodopsin in terms of bilayer curvature deformation (strain) and hydrophobic solvation energy. The bilayer stress is related to the lateral pressure profile in terms of the spontaneous curvature and associated bending rigidity. Transduction of the strain energy (frustration) of the bilayer drives protein oligomerization and conformational changes in a coupled manner. Our findings illuminate the physical principles of membrane protein association due to chemically nonspecific interactions in fluid lipid bilayers. Moreover, they yield a conceptual framework for understanding how the tightly regulated lipid compositions of cellular membranes influence their protein-mediated functions.},

The spin sensitivity of high-frequency EPR is excellent with less than 20 pmol of sample required to obtain spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios. Simulation of the temperature-dependent spectral lineshapes reveals the existence of local anisotropic motion about the nitroxide N-O bond with a motional anisotropy [tau][perpendicular]/[tau]|| ([equiv] N) approaching 2.6 at 306 K. Comparison with previous work on rigidly labeled peptides suggests that the spin label is reorienting about its side-chain tether.

abstract = {This work demonstrates that homogeneous linewidths can be extracted from continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and that they quantitatively agree with the predictions of existing relaxation theory. We suggest that relaxation theory can be used to predict experimental lineshapes provided that the simulations properly include sources of broadening. We have found that the rotational correlation times for spin labels in different percentages of glycerol/water mixtures are best modeled by a power law treatment for the viscosity, similar to that for translational diffusion. The translational diffusion coefficients themselves also have a power law dependence on the viscosity for glycerol/water mixtures. The linewidths were linearly dependent upon both the oxygen and the spin label concentration. The hyperfine splittings of all nuclei were observed to decrease linearly with increasing spin label concentration, completely at odds with existing theory which predicts a quadratic dependence upon concentration. The linear dependence was independent of hyperfine splitting until the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting was less than the homogeneous linewidth.},

It is non-invasive and non-destructive, and one of very few techniques that can observe internal events inside undisturbed specimens in situ. It is versatile, as a wide range of NMR modalities can be accessed, and 2D and 3D imaging can be undertaken. Despite widespread use and major advances in clinical MRI, it has seen limited application in the pharmaceutical sciences. In vitro studies have focussed on drug release mechanisms in polymeric delivery systems, but isolated studies of bioadhesion, tablet properties, and extrusion and mixing processes illustrate the wider potential. Perhaps the greatest potential however, lies in investigations of pharmaceuticals in vivo, where pilot human and animal studies have demonstrated we can obtain unique insights into the behaviour of gastrointestinal, topical, colloidal, and targeted drug delivery systems.},

Control over the formation of CH(3)CO from (CH3)2CO, CF3 (or CH3) from CH3COCF3, and C6H5CH3 (toluene) from C6H5COCH3 was observed with high selectivity. Strong-field control appears to have generic applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored intense laser fields (about 10(13) watts per square centimeter) can dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently, the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found in the perturbative (weak-field) regime.},

Studies of a ternary complex formed from the substrate analog folate and oxidized NADP+ cofactor revealed conformational exchange between a ground state, in which the active site loops adopt a closed conformation, and a weakly populated (4.2\% at 30 degrees C) excited state with the loops in the occluded conformation. Fluctuations between these states, which involve motions of the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor into and out of the active site, occur on a time scale that is directly relevant to the structural transitions involved in progression through the catalytic cycle.},

During operation in a microsecond pulse length regime with 13-kV beam voltage and 110-mA beam current, the instrument generates several watts of power in two second harmonic modes, the TE/sub 2,6,1/ at 456.15 GHz and the TE/sub 0,6,1/ at 458.56 GHz. Operation in the fundamental modes, including the TE/sub 0,3,1/ mode at 237.91 GHz and the TE/sub 2,3,1/ at 233.15 GHz, is observed at output powers up to 70 W. Further, we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning of the fundamental modes of the oscillator over a range of more than 2 GHz through variation of the magnetic field alone. We interpret these results in terms of smooth transitions between higher order axial modes of the resonator. The 460 GHz gyrotron is currently being processed for continuous duty operation, where it will serve as a microwave source for sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (dynamic nuclear polarization) studies at 16 T (700 MHz /sup 1/H), a field strength which is two-fold higher than has been accessible with previous technology. },

We have calculated translational diffusion residence times, orientational decay time constants, the infrared spectra, correlation functions describing the hydrogen bond network, the hydrogen bond exchange time and rate constant, and ensemble averages of the hydrogen bond exchange reaction coordinate. We focus on the interfacial layer and bulklike interior of these small water containing nanostructures. Our results indicate a universal slowdown in rotational and hydrogen bond dynamics at the interface relative to bulk water. The interiors of nanopores with highly charged interfaces undergo qualitatively different dynamics than those in other nanopores. The rotational jump hydrogen bond exchange mechanism is shown to be robust and universal, even for this variety of interfaces. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the role of confinement vs interface structure on water dynamics in nanopores.},

It therefore appears to be impossible to unambiguously discuss dielectric spectra of complex biological tissues in which different polarization mechanisms overlap.

abstract = {Water proton spin-lattice relaxation is studied in dilute solutions of bovine serum albumin as a function of magnetic field strength, oxygen concentration, and solvent deuteration. In contrast to previous studies conducted at high protein concentrations, the observed relaxation dispersion is accurately Lorentzian with an effective correlation time of 41 \{+/-\} 3 ns when measured at low proton and low protein concentrations to minimize protein aggregation. Elimination of oxygen flattens the relaxation dispersion profile above the rotational inflection frequency, nearly eliminating the high field tail previously attributed to a distribution of exchange times for either whole water molecules or individual protons at the protein-water interface. The small high-field dispersion that remains is attributed to motion of the bound water molecules on the protein or to internal protein motions on a time scale of order one ns. Measurements as a function of isotope composition permit separation of intramolecular and intermolecular relaxation contributions. The magnitude of the intramolecular proton-proton relaxation rate constant is interpreted in terms of 25 \{+/-\} 4 water molecules that are bound rigidly to the protein for a time long compared with the rotational correlation time of 42 ns. This number of bound water molecules neglects the possibility of local motions of the water in the binding site; inclusion of these effects may increase the number of bound water molecules by 50\%.},

abstract = {Context:Animal studies revealed that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), due to their metabolic characteristics, are not stored in skeletal muscle and may therefore not give rise to potentially hazardous lipid species impeding insulin signaling.Objective:We here hypothesized that infusion of medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCT) in healthy lean subjects does not lead to ectopic fat accumulation and hence does not result in lipid-induced insulin resistance.Design and Methods:Nine healthy lean male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with simultaneous infusion of 1) a 100\% long-chain triacylglycerols (LCT) emulsion, 2) a 50/50\% MCT/LCT emulsion, or 3) glycerol in a randomized crossover design. Muscle biopsies were taken before and after each clamp.Results:MCT/LCT infusion raised plasma free fatty acid levels to a similar level compared with LCT infusion alone. Despite elevated free fatty acid levels, intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) levels were not affected by the MCT/LCT emulsion, whereas LCT infusion resulted in an approximately 1.6-fold increase in IMTG. These differences in muscle fat accumulation did not result in significant differences in lipid-induced insulin resistance between LCT (-28\%, P = 0.003) and MCT/LCT (-20\%, P < 0.001). Total skeletal muscle ceramide content as well as lactosyl- and glucosylceramide levels were not affected by any of the interventions. In addition, the distribution pattern of all ceramide species remained unaltered.Conclusions:Although we confirm that MCFA do not lead to ceramide and IMTG accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue in humans, they do induce insulin resistance. These results indicate that, in humans, MCFA may not be beneficial in preventing peripheral insulin resistance.},

With the coarse-grained field thus defined, the string method in collective variables was used to compute a minimum free-energy pathway (MFEP) for the collapsing chain. These calculations provide a proof of principle for a coarse-grained description of water solvent. Furthermore, the calculated MFEP characterizes the mechanism for the collapse of the hydrated chain by providing a path of maximum likelihood for dynamical trajectories. The reliability of the calculated MFEP was confirmed with the use of conventional molecular dynamics trajectories. Analysis of the MFEP provides atomistic confirmation for the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse proposed by ten Wolde and Chandler. In particular, we show that length-scale-dependent hydrophobic dewetting is the rate-limiting step in the hydrophobic collapse of the considered chain.},

The reduction in effective macromolecular tumbling is directly dependent upon the viscosity of the solvent. Liquid ethane is of sufficiently low viscosity at pressures below 5000 psi to offer a significant advantage. Unfortunately, the viscosity of liquid ethane shows appreciable pressure dependence. Reverse micelle encapsulation in liquid ethane often requires significantly higher pressures, which obviates the potential advantages offered by liquid ethane over liquid propane. Addition of co-surfactants or co-solvents can be used to manipulate the minimum pressure required to obtain stable, well-behaved solutions of reverse micelles prepared in liquid ethane. A library of potential additives is examined and several candidates suitable for use with encapsulated proteins are described.},

abstract = {Imaging of free radicals in vivo using an interleaved field-cycled proton-electron double-resonance imaging (FC-PEDRI) pulse sequence has recently been studied. To reduce the EPR (ESR) irradn. power required and the imaging time, a centric reordered snapshot FC-PEDRI pulse sequence was implemented. This is based on the FLASH pulse sequence with a very short repetition time and the use of centric reordering of the phase-encoding gradient, allowing the most significant free induction decay (FID) signals to be collected before the signal enhancement decays significantly. A new technique of signal phase-shift correction was required to eliminate ghost artifacts caused by the instability of the main magnetic field after field cycling. An FID amplitude correction scheme also was implemented to reduce edge enhancement artifacts caused by the rapid change of magnetization population before reaching the steady state. Using the rapid pulse sequence, the time required for acquisition of a 64 * 64 pixel FC-PEDRI image was reduced to 6 s per image compared with .apprx.2.5 min with the conventional pulse sequence. The EPR irradn. power applied to the sample was reduced by a factor of .apprx.64. Although the resulting images obtained by the rapid pulse sequence have a lower signal to noise than those obtained by a normal interleaved FC-PEDRI pulse sequence, rapid imaging of free radicals in vivo using snapshot FC-PEDRI is possible.

Data obtained by saturating the nitroxide EPR line at a field-frequency combination determined after employing the Breit-Rabi formalism are most satisfactory provided low radical concentrations are used. Ratio method determinations of ultimate enhancements are appropriate in most cases, although application of an exchange-based model by using data on the broadening of spectra as the spin-label concentration is increased may provide a means of determining ultimate enhancements when the ratio method is not applicable. Studies with several nitroxide radicals show that similar species give polarization results that do not change when substituents far removed from the localized unpaired electron are changed. Perfluoropyridine is shown to exhibit increased scalar-dominated polarization with more aromatic nitroxides as has been observed for hexafluorobenzene; the dipolar-dominated enhancements for both monofluorobenzene and 2-fluoropyridine are also similar.},

abstract = {Purpose: The feasibility of hyperpolarized 129Xe for fast MR angiography (MRA) was evaluated using the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique. Material and Methods: Hyperpolarized Xe gas was dissolved in ethanol, a carrier agent with high solubility for Xe (Ostwald solubility coefficient 2.5) and long relaxation times. The dissolved Xe was injected as a bolus into a flow phantom where the mean flow velocity was 15 cm/s. Ultrafast EPI images with 44 ms scan time were acquired of the flowing bolus and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were measured. Results: The relaxation times of hyperpolarized Xe in ethanol were measured to T1=160+-11 s and T2=20 s. The resulting images of the flowing liquid were of reasonable quality and had an SNR of about 70. Conclusion: Based on the SNR of the obtained Xe EPI images, it was estimated that rapid in vivo MRA with 129Xe may be feasible, provided that an efficient, biologically acceptable carrier for Xe can be found and polarization levels of more than 25\% can be achieved in isotopically enriched 129Xe.},

abstract = {The aggregation of soluble proteins into fibrillar species is a complex process that spans many lengths and time scales, and that involves the formation of numerous on-pathway and off-pathway intermediate species. Despite this complexity, several elements underlying the aggregation process appear to be universal. The kinetics typically follows a nucleation-growth process, and proteins with very different sequences aggregate to form similar fibril structures, populating intermediates with sufficient structural similarity to bind to a common antibody. This review focuses on a computational approach that exploits the common features of aggregation to simplify or 'coarse-grain' the representation of the protein. We highlight recent developments in coarse-grained modeling and illustrate how these models have been able to shed new light into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of aggregation intermediates. The roles of aggregation prone conformations in the monomeric state and the influence of inherent $\beta$-sheet and aggregation propensities in modulating aggregation pathways are discussed.},

This effect is multifaceted depending on whether hydrophobic molecules are individually hydrated or driven to assemble into larger structures. Despite the basic principles underlying the hydrophobic effect being qualitatively well understood, only recently have theoretical developments begun to explain and quantify many features of this ubiquitous phenomenon.},

This technique has very low insertion loss and allows a number of sophisticated measurement techniques to be employed including induction operation, which significantly reduces the effect of microphonics and stray reflections.

abstract = {Proton electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) measures the spatial distribution of paramagnetic species in biol. samples using the Overhauser effect. Triaryl Me (TAM) free radicals have been developed as a spin probe for PEDRI since they have very long T1e. Therefore, low RF power levels are sufficient to sat. the electron spin system with resultant high NMR enhancement facilitating application of PEDRI in living animals. In this report, PEDRI studies were performed at 0.02 T. The power-dependent image enhancement was studied using phantoms of TAM in saline, then the distribution and pharmacokinetics of TAM in living mice were measured. Following i.v. administration of 0.7 mmol/kg of TAM, enhancements of up to -34 were obsd. enabling visualization of its distribution within the body. Maximum uptake of TAM in the vascular compartment was seen 1 min postadministration with half-clearance within 5 min. Maximum uptake in the kidneys occurred at 10 min with half-clearance at 26 min and max. accumulation in the bladder after 50 min. Thus, TAM is initially compartmentalized in the vasculature and this is followed by rapid uptake and excretion by the kidneys. PEDRI enabled rapid imaging of the distribution and clearance of this paramagnetic probe and this information should facilitate the use of TAM as a label for oximetry and other applications.

abstract = {We present the first study of quantifying the diffusion coefficient of interfacial water on polyelectrolyte surfaces of systems fully dispersed in bulk water under ambient conditions. Such measurements were made possible through the implementation of a recently introduced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) technique to selectively amplify the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal of hydration water that is interacting with specifically located spin labels on polyelectrolyte surfaces. The merit of this novel capability is demonstrated in this report through the measurement of solvent microvisosity on the surface of two types of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, when freely dissolved versus when complexed to form a liquid-liquid colloidal phase called complex coacervates. These complex coacervates were formed through electrostatic complexation between the imidazole-based cationic homopolymer poly(N-vinylimidazole) (PVIm), and anionic polypeptide polyaspartate (PAsp) in the pH range of 4.5 - 6.0, under which conditions the coacervate droplets are highly fluidic yet densely packed with polyelectrolytes. We also investigated the rotational diffusion coefficients of the spin labels covalently bound to the polyelectrolyte chains for both PVIm and PAsp, showing a 5 fold change in the rotational correlation time as well as anisotropy parameter upon coacervation, which represents a surprisingly small decrease given the high polymer concentration inside the dense microdroplets. For both DNP and ESR experiments, the polymers were covalently tagged with stable nitroxide radical spin labels (∼1 wt \%) to probe the local solvent and polymer segment dynamics. We found that the surface water diffusion coefficients near uncomplexed PVIm and PAsp at pH 8 differ, and are around D∼1.3×10(-9)m(2) / s. In contrast, inside the complex coacervate phase, the water diffusion coefficient in the immediate vicinity of either polyelectrolyte was D∼ 0.25×10(-9)m(2) / s, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the bulk water self diffusion coefficient, and yet orders of magnitude greater than that of associated, bound, hydration water. This observation suggests the existence of measurable water inside complex coacervates with relatively high diffusion and exchange dynamics, implying that water moves in nanometer-scale pore spaces as opposed to being structurally bound or even absent. We infer from our observation that the PVIm and PAsp chains are undergoing roughly pairwise association, so that largely charge neutralized species compose the concentrated, yet fluidic and partially hydrated coacervate cores.},

abstract = {High-field/high-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) offers improved sensitivity and resolution compared to ESR at conventional fields and frequencies. However, most high-field/high-frequency ESR spectrometers suffer from limited mm-wave power, thereby requiring long mm-wave pulses. This precludes their use when relaxation times are short, e.g., in fluid samples. Low mm-wave power is also a major factor limiting the achievable spectral coverage and thereby the multiplex advantage of Fourier transform ESR (FTESR) experiments. High-power pulses are needed to perform two-dimensional (213) FTESR experiments, which can unravel the dynamics of a spin system in great detail, making it an excellent tool for studying spin and molecular dynamics. We report on the design and implementation of a high-power, high-bandwidth, pulsed ESR spectrometer operating at 95 GHz. One of the principal design goals was the ability to investigate dynamic processes in aqueous samples at physiological temperatures with the intent to study biological systems. In initial experiments on aqueous samples at room temperature, we achieved 200 MHz spectral coverage at a sensitivity of 1.1x10(10)roots spins and a dead time of less than 50 ns. 2D-electron-electron double resonance experiments on aqueous samples are discussed to demonstrate the practical application of such a spectrometer. 0 2004 American Institute Of Physics.},

abstract = {A numerical model of the behaviour of the magnetization in a field-cycled dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiment is presented, with the aim of optimizing pulse sequence parameters in field-cycled proton-electron double-resonance free radical imaging. The model is used to predict the observed enhancement of the NMR signal as a function of the magnetic field strength, EPR irradiation frequency and pulse sequence timing, as well as the propel-ties of the sample including the NMR and EPR relaxation times. The model allowed optimization of parameters in the field-cycled DNP experiment, in particular the EPR irradiation frequency. to find the value which would give the largest difference between NMR signals recorded with and without EPR irradiation. Experiments to verify the model were carried out using aqueous solutions of TEMPOL, which exhibits three hyperfine lines in its EPR spectrum and triarylmethyl (TAM), which has a single, narrow line. It was found that the model predicted very well the variation in DNP enhancement with EPR irradiation power for both samples. The behaviour of the NMR signal with EPR irradiation frequency in studies using TEMPOL was also accurately modelled, with the optimum frequency lying between 60 and 80 MHz. depending on the EPR irradiation power. The optimum frequency obtained from the model also agreed with the experimental data obtained using the TAM free radical, but with this sample the theoretical curves tended to deviate from the experimental data at irradiation frequencies below 70 MHz.},

In the XRD experiments, the samples were loaded on a small plate sample holder that was kept horizontal while measurements were made at 30, 150, and 300 degreesC. The layer distances between aromatic sheets of asphaltenes were similar to3.6 Angstrom, and the number of aromatic sheets in a stacked cluster decreased from eight to five as the temperature increased from 30 degreesC to 300 degreesC. The different crystallite parameters varied little between the three asphaltenes, although maltenes in the vacuum residua interacted with the asphaltenes and loosened their stacking by a small amount. In SAXS experiments, scattering patterns were obtained on the dry asphaltenes at room temperature in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere and the samples were then heated from 30 degreesC to 500 degreesC. The fractal aggregates of As-MY, As-KF, and As-IL broke down at 241, 179, and 243 degreesC, respectively. From these results, and earlier small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, a hypothetical hierarchical model of asphaltene aggregation is proposed.},

By attaching nitroxide based spin labels to molecules and by measuring the (1)H DNP response of solvent water, information about the local hydration dynamics near the spin label can be obtained. However, there are two commonly used types of nitroxide ring structures; a pyrroline based and a piperidine based molecule. It is important to know when comparing different experiments, whether changes in DNP enhancements are due to changes in local hydration dynamics or because of the different spin label structures. In this study we investigate the key parameters affecting DNP signal enhancements for 3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-1-oxyl, a 5-membered ring nitroxide radical, and for 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, a 6-membered ring nitroxide radical. Using X-Band DNP, field cycling relaxometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the key parameters affecting the DNP amplitude of the (1)H signal of water to be equal when using either nitroxide.

abstract = {In the densely filled biological cells often subdiffusion is observed, where the average squared displacement increases slower than linear with the length of the observation interval. One reason for such subdiffusive behavior is attractive interactions between the diffusing particles that lead to temporary complex formation. Here, we show that such transient binding is not an average state of the particles but that intervals of free diffusion alternate with slower displacement when bound to neighboring particles. The observed macroscopic behavior is then the weighted average of these two contributions. Interestingly, even at very high concentrations, the unbound fraction still exhibits essentially normal diffusion.},

abstract = {The endogenous substance pyruvate is of major importance to maintain energy homeostasis in the cells and provides a window to several important metabolic processes essential to cell survival. Cell viability is therefore reflected in the metabolism of pyruvate. NMR spectroscopy has until now been the only noninvasive method to gain insight into the fate of pyruvate in the body, but the low NMR sensitivity even at high field strength has only allowed information about steady-state conditions. The medically relevant information about the distribution, localization, and metabolic rate of the substance during the first minute after the injection has not been obtainable. Use of a hyperpolarization technique has enabled 10-15\% polarization of C-13(1) in up to a 0.3 M pyruvate solution. i.v. injection of the solution into rats and pigs allows imaging of the distribution of pyruvate and mapping of its major metabolites lactate and alanine within a time frame of approximate to 10 s. Real-time molecular imaging with MRI has become a reality.},

abstract = {Frequency-modulated (FM) pulses have practical advantages for spin-echo experiments, such as the ability to produce a broadband pi rotation, with an inhomogeneous radiofrequency (RF) field. However, such use leads to a nonlinear phase of the transverse magnetization, which is why FM pulses like the hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse are not commonly used for multislice spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, a general theory and methods are described for conventional spin-echo imaging using a pi HS pulse for refocusing. Phase profiles produced by the HS pulse are analytically described. The analysis is extended to yield the specific relationships between pulse parameters and gradients, which must be satisfied to compensate the nonlinear phase variation produced with a spin-echo sequence composed of pi/2 and pi HS pulses (the pi/2 HS - pi HS sequence). The latter offers advantages for multislice spin-echo MRI, including excellent slice-selection and partial compensation for RF inhomogeneity. Furthermore, it can be implemented with a shorter echo time and lower power deposition than a previously described method using a pair of pi HS pulses.},

The device facilitates rapid, uniform mixing by decoupling hydrodynamic focusing from diffusive mixing and accesses time scales of tens of microseconds. The mixer is used in conjunction with multiphoton microscopy to examine the fast Ca2+-induced transitions of acrylodan-labeled calmodulin. We find that the kinetic rates of the conformational changes in two homologous globular domains differ by more than an order of magnitude. The characteristic time constants are approximately 490 micros for the transitions in the C-terminal domain and approximately 20 ms for those in the N-terminal domain of the protein. We discuss possible mechanisms for the two distinct events and the biological role of the stable intermediate, half-saturated calmodulin.},

abstract = {A high-frequency dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)/electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer operating at 211 MHz for1H and 140 GHz forg= 2 paramagnetic centers (5 T static field) is described. The salient feature of the instrument is a cyclotron-resonance maser (gyrotron) which generates high-frequency, high-power microwave radiation. This gyrotron, which under conventional operation produces millisecond pulses at kilowatt powers, has been adapted to operate at \~{}100 W for 1 to 20 s pulses and in the continuous wave mode at the 10 W power level. Experiments combining DNP with magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance were performed on samples consisting of 2\% by weight of the free radical BDPA doped into polystyrene. Room-temperature DNP enhancement factors of 10 for1H and 40 for13C were obtained in the NMR-MAS spectra. Static DNP NMR has also been performed on samples containing nitroxides dissolved in water:glycerol solvent mixtures. Enhancements of approximately 200 have been obtained for low-temperature (14 K)1H NMR. A pulsed/CW EPR spectrometer operating at 140 GHz has been developed in conjunction with the DNP spectrometer. Microwave sources include Gunn-diode oscillators which provide low-power (20 mW) radiation, and the gyrotron, which has been used to deliver higher power levels in pulsed experiments. Results using this spectrometer are presented for continuous-wave and echo-detected EPR, electron spin-echo-envelope modulation (ESEEM), and Fourier-transform EPR.},

We outline the major fluorescence microscopy-based methods to determine the mobility and thus the diffusion coefficients (D) of molecules, which is not trivial in small cells. The extremely high macromolecule crowding of prokaryotes is used to rationalize the reported lower diffusion coefficients as compared to eukaryotes, and we speculate on the nature of the barriers for diffusion observed for proteins (and mRNAs) in vivo. Building on in vitro experiments and modeling studies, we evaluate the size dependence of diffusion coefficients for macromolecules in vivo, in case of both water-soluble and integral membrane proteins. We comment on the possibilities of anomalous diffusion and provide examples where the macromolecule mobility may be limiting biological processes.},

The adsorption-desorption behavior of NO probe molecules is studied at different temperatures for Na-A, Na-ZSM-5, H-ZSM-5, and silicalite. Adsorbed NO molecules form paramagnetic adsorption complexes with Lewis acid sites which can be examined by EPR transitions ([Delta]mS+/-1) at g[approximate]2.0. Otherwise the desorption of NO into the gas phase can be monitored by the typical nine-line EPR spectrum ([Delta]mJ+/-1) of the 2[Pi]3/2 state at g[approximate]0.7776. This gas-phase signal is used to study the overall adsorption-desorption properties of the zeolites in the temperature range 150 K[lsim]T[lsim]300 K. At lower temperatures the probe molecules are adsorbed at the Lewis acid sites inside the nanoporous materials and produce an intensive spectrum at T[lsim]110 K. But at intermediate temperatures 110 K[lsim]T[lsim]150 K the NO molecules are adsorbed only for a few hundred picoseconds because the lifetime of the adsorption complexes is limited by the beginning desorption processes. The decreasing lifetime of the adsorption complex with rising temperature results in an increasing homogeneous line broadening of their EPR signals. An analysis of the line-broadening effects provides an opportunity for determining the specific desorption energies EA(H-ZSM-5)=(20.2+/-7.3) kJ/mol, EA(Na-ZSM-5)=(4.1+/-1.5) kJ/mol, and EA(Na-A)=(7.1+/-2.1) kJ/mol for NO probe molecules at sodium cations and aluminum defect centers just below the desorption temperature.},

abstract = {The time-resolved orientational anisotropies of the OD hydroxyl stretch of dilute HOD in H(2)O confined on a nanometer length scale in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles are studied using ultrafast infrared polarization and spectrally resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, and the results are compared to the same experiments on bulk water. The orientational anisotropy data for three water nanopool sizes (4.0, 2.4, and 1.7 nm) can be fitted well with biexponential decays. The biexponential decays are analyzed using a wobbling-in-a-cone model that involves fast orientational diffusion within a cone followed by slower, full orientational relaxation. The data provide the cone angles, the diffusion constants for motion within the cones, and the final diffusion constants as a function of the nanopool size. The two processes can be interpreted as a local angular fluctuation of the OD and a global hydrogen bond network rearrangement process. The trend in the relative amplitudes of the long and short exponential decays suggest an increasing rigidity as the nanopool size decreases. The trend in the long decay constants indicates a longer hydrogen bond network rearrangement time with decreasing reverse micelle size. The anisotropy measurements for the reverse micelles studied extrapolate to approximately 0.33 rather than the ideal value of 0.4, suggesting the presence of an initial inertial component in the anisotropy decay that is too fast to resolve. The very fast decay component is consistent with initial inertial orientational motion that is seen in published molecular-dynamics simulations of water in AOT reverse micelles. The angle over which the inertial orientational motion occurs is determined. The results are in semiquantitative agreement with the molecular-dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {Due to high temperature factors and the lack of considerable electron density, electron microscopy and X-ray experiments on the cytoplasmic E-F loop of bacteriorhodopsin result in a variety of structural models. As the experimental conditions regarding ionic strength, temperature and the presence of detergents may affect the structure of the E-F loop, we employ electron paramagnetic resonance and site-directed spin-labeling to study the structure of this loop under physiological conditions. The amino acid residues at positions 154 to 171 were replaced by cysteine residues and derivatized with a sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide spin label one by one. The conventional and power saturation electron paramagnetic spectroscopy provide the mobility of the nitroxide and its accessibility to dissolved molecular oxygen and membrane-impermeable chromium oxalate in the respective site. The results show that K159 and A168 are located at the water-lipid interface of helices E and F, respectively. The orientation of the amino acid side-chains in the helical regions from positions 154 to 159 and 166 to 171 were found to agree with published structural data for bacteriorhodopsin. In the residue sequence from positions 160 to 165 the EPR data yield evidence for a turned loop structure with the side-chains of M163 and S162 oriented towards the proton channel and the water phase, respectively.},

abstract = {This work presents the design, construction, and experimental testing of unique sensitive surface loop-gap microresonators for electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. These resonators are made of "U"-shaped gold structures with typical sizes of 50 and 150 $\mu$m that are deposited on a thin (220 $\mu$m) rutile substrate and fed from the rear by a microstrip line. This allows accommodating a large flat sample above the resonator in addition to having variable coupling properties. Such resonators have a very small volume which, compared to previous designs, improves their absolute spin sensitivity by a factor of more than 2 (based on experimental results). They also have a very high microwave field-power conversion ratio of up to 86 gauss/√Hz. This could facilitate the use of very short excitation pulses with relatively low microwave power. Following the presentation and the discussion of the experimental results, ways to further increase sensitivity significantly are outlined.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {The protein dynamical transition and its connection with the liquid-glass transition (GT) of hydration water and aqueous solvents are reviewed. The protein solvation shell exhibits a regular glass transition, characterized by steps in the specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient at the calorimetric glass temperature T(G) approximately 170 K. It implies that the time scale of the structural alpha-relaxation has reached the experimental time window of 1-100 s. The protein dynamical transition, identified from elastic neutron scattering experiments by enhanced amplitudes of molecular motions exceeding the vibrational level, probes the alpha-process on a shorter time scale. The corresponding liquid-glass transition occurs at higher temperatures, typically 240 K. The GT is generally associated with diverging viscosities, the freezing of long-range translational diffusion in the supercooled liquid. Due to mutual hydrogen bonding, both, protein- and solvent relaxational degrees of freedom slow down in paralleled near the GT. However, the freezing of protein motions, where surface-coupled rotational and librational degrees of freedom are arrested, is better characterized as a rubber-glass transition. In contrast, internal protein modes such as the rotation of side chains are not affected. Moreover, ligand binding experiments with myoglobin in various glass-forming solvents show, that only ligand entry and exit rates depend on the local viscosity near the protein surface, but protein-internal ligand migration is not coupled to the solvent. The GT leads to structural arrest on a macroscopic scale due to the microscopic cage effect on the scale of the intermolecular distance. Mode coupling theory provides a theoretical framework to understand the microscopic nature of the GT even in complex systems. The role of the alpha- and beta-process in the dynamics of protein hydration water is evaluated. The protein-solvent GT is triggered by hydrogen bond fluctuations, which give rise to fast beta-processes. High-frequency neutron scattering spectra indicate increasing hydrogen bond braking above T(G).},

On the other hand, the 19F nuclei gave pos. DNP values of .apprx.10, corresponding to a predominantly scalar coupling with the unpaired electrons.

abstract = {We present the implementation of optimal control into the open source simulation package SIMPSON for development and optimization of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for a wide range of applications, including liquid- and solid-state NMR, magnetic resonance imaging, quantum computation, and combinations between NMR and other spectroscopies. Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},

abstract = {When the dipole potential of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers was decreased, either by the insertion of phloretin or by the elimination of carbonyl groups at the interphase, the surface charge potential was displaced to lower negative values. At low ionic strength, the decrease of the negative charge density can be ascribed to a different exposure of the phosphate to water, as there is a good correlation to an increase in the area per lipid. At high ionic strength, the magnitude of the changes in the zeta potential produced by the effects on the dipole potential was found to be dependent on the type of anions present in the subphase. Differences between Cl- and ClO4- were ascribed to the adsorption of anions according to their different hydrations and polarizabilities. The influence of a low dipole potential on the anion adsorption can be ascribed to a less positive image charge at the membrane interior, resulting from an increase in the hydrocarbon core permittivity. This is congruent with the neutralization of interfacial dipoles and the area increase, as well as with the decrease in packing of the hydrocarbon groups. Phloretin did not cause changes in the dipole potential of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), and in consequence, no effects on the zeta potential were measured. It is concluded that changes in the inner water/hydrocarbon plane affect the electrostatic potential measured in the outer plane of the polar headgroup region.},

The dependence of the polarization on microwave frequency, radical concentration and electron saturation was studied. For optimized conditions, a (13)C polarization equal to 64+/-5\% was obtained, an increase by more than a factor of two compared with earlier results at 3.35 T of the same system. It was furthermore observed that the addition of gadolinium, which resulted in a twofold polarization increase at 3.35 T, only resulted in a minor improvement at 4.64 T. The dependence of the electron saturation on microwave frequency and microwave power was quantified by first moment measurements which were obtained by nucleus-electron double resonance (NEDOR) experiments. Complete electron saturation was observed for a microwave frequency close to the centre frequency of the ESR line, and by using maximum power of the microwave source. The DNP build-up time at 4.64 T (approximately 3000 s) was prolonged by approximately a factor three over the build-up time at 3.35 T (approximately 1200 s). However, after approximately 20 min of microwave irradiation the polarization at 4.64 T exceeded the polarization at 3.35 T.},

However the electro-chemical free energy of solvation of ions resides largely in the first two water layers, which control the interfacial behavior of the ions and require explicit modeling to capture their distinctive behaviors. The resulting short range forces produce such surprising charge density-dependent behaviors as ion adsorption onto nonpolar surfaces, like charge aggregation of ions, and substantial ion pairing preferences, which arise largely from the affinity of specific ions for individual water molecules. Specific ion effects controlled by the local water affinity of the ion show a diagnostic change of sign between strongly hydrated Na(+) and weakly hydrated K(+) and between strongly hydrated F(-) and weakly hydrated Cl(-), in both cases marking the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution, a critical benchmark missing from continuum electrostatics models.},

abstract = {Protein folding is a spontaneous process that is essential for life, yet the concentrated and complex interior of a cell is an inherently hostile environment for the efficient folding of many proteins. Some proteins-constrained by sequence, topology, size, and function-simply cannot fold by themselves and are instead prone to misfolding and aggregation. This problem is so deeply entrenched that a specialized family of proteins, known as molecular chaperones, evolved to assist in protein folding. Here we examine one essential class of molecular chaperones, the large, oligomeric, and energy utilizing chaperonins or Hsp60s. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL, along with its co-chaperonin GroES, is probably the best-studied example of this family of protein-folding machine. In this review, we examine some of the general properties of proteins that do not fold well in the absence of GroEL and then consider how folding of these proteins is enhanced by GroEL and GroES.

abstract = {We report an approach that extends the applicability of ultrasensitive force-gradient detection of magnetic resonance to samples with spin-lattice relaxation times (T (1)) as short as a single cantilever period. To demonstrate the generality of the approach, which relies on detecting either cantilever frequency or phase, we used it to detect electron spin resonance from a T (1) = 1 ms nitroxide spin probe in a thin film at 4.2 K and 0.6 T. By using a custom-fabricated cantilever with a 4 microm-diameter nickel tip, we achieve a magnetic resonance sensitivity of 400 Bohr magnetons in a 1 Hz bandwidth. A theory is presented that quantitatively predicts both the lineshape and the magnitude of the observed cantilever frequency shift as a function of field and cantilever-sample separation. Good agreement was found between nitroxide T (1) 's measured mechanically and inductively, indicating that the cantilever magnet is not an appreciable source of spin-lattice relaxation here. We suggest that the new approach has a number of advantages that make it well suited to push magnetic resonance detection and imaging of nitroxide spin labels in an individual macromolecule to single-spin sensitivity.},

abstract = {We propose a novel picture of the rotation mechanism of F(1)-ATPase, a rotary-motor protein complex. Entropy, which originates from the translational displacement of water molecules, is treated as the key factor in the proposal. We calculate the water entropy gains upon formation of the $\alpha$-$\beta$, $\alpha$-$\gamma$, and $\beta$-$\gamma$ subunit pairs. The gain is given as the difference between the hydration entropy of a subunit pair and the sum of the hydration entropies of the separate subunits forming the pair. The calculation is made using a hybrid of a statistical-mechanical theory for molecular liquids and morphometric approach. The water entropy gain is considered as a measure of tightness of the packing at each subunit interface. The results are highly correlated with the numbers of stable contacts at the subunit interfaces estimated by a molecular dynamics simulation. We also calculate the hydration entropies of three different subcomplexes comprising the $\gamma$ subunit, one of the $\beta$ subunits, and two $\alpha$ subunits adjacent to them. The major finding is that the packing in F(1)-ATPase is highly asymmetrical, and this asymmetry is ascribed to the water entropy effect. We discuss how the rotation of the $\gamma$ subunit is induced by such chemical processes as ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and release of the products. In our picture, the asymmetrical packing plays crucially important roles, and the rotation is driven by the water entropy effect.},

abstract = {Comparative analysis of the photoelectric response of dried films of purple membranes (PM) depending on their degree of orientation is presented. Time dependence of the photo-induced protein electric response signal (PERS) of oriented and non-oriented films to a single laser pulse in the presence of the external electric field (EEF) was experimentally determined. The signal does not appear in the non-oriented films when the EEF is absent, whereas the PERS of the oriented PM films demonstrates the variable polarity on the microsecond time scale. In the presence of the EEF the PERS of the non-oriented film rises exponentially preserving the same polarization. The polarization of the PERS changes by changing the polarity of the EEF with no influence on the time constant of the PERS kinetics. The EEF effect on the PERS of the oriented films is more complicated. By subtracting the PERS when EEF not equal 0 from the PERS when EEF = 0 the resulting signal is comparable to that of the non-oriented films. Generalizing the experimental data we conclude that the EEF influence is of the same origin for the films of any orientation. To explain the experimental results the two-state model is suggested. It assumes that the EEF directionally changes the pK(a) values of the Schiff base (SB) and of the proton acceptor aspartic acid D85 in bacteriorhodopsin. Because of that the SB-->D85 proton transfer might be blocked and consequently the L-->M intermediate transition should vanish. Thus, on the characteristic time scale tau( L --> M ) approximately 30 micros; both intermediates, the M intermediate, appearing under normal conditions, and the L intermediate as persisting under the blocked conditions when D85 is protonated, should coexist in the film. The total PERS is a result of the potentials corresponding to the electrogenic products of intermediates L and M that are of the opposite polarity. It is concluded that the ratio of bacteriorhodopsin concentrations corresponding to the L and M intermediates is driven by the EEF and, consequently, it should define the PERS of the non-oriented films. According to this model the orientation degree of the film could be evaluated by describing the PERS.},

abstract = {In Overhauser enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (OMRI) for in vivo measurement of oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), a paramagnetic contrast agent is introduced to enhance the proton signal through dynamic nuclear polarization. A uniform proton T-1 is generally assumed for the entire region of interest for the computation of PO2 using OMRI. It is demonstrated here, by both phantom and in vivo (mice) imaging, that such an assumption may cause erroneous estimate of PO2. A direct estimate of pixel-wise T-1 is hampered by the poor native MR intensities, owing to the very low Zeeman field (15-20 mT) in OMRI. To circumvent this problem, a simple method for the pixel-wise mapping of proton T-1 using the OMRI scanner is described. A proton T-1 image of a slice through the center of an SCC tumor in a mouse clearly shows a range of T-1 distribution (0.2 similar to 1.6 s). Computation of PO2 images using pixel-wise T-1 values promises oximetry with minimal artifacts by OMRI. Published 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The polarization of the nuclear spins can be increased significantly if the electron spin polarization is kept out of equilibrium. We employ semiclassical relaxation theory to analyze the electronic polarization of the two-spin system characteristic of nitroxide radicals. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the nitroxide TEMPOL in water are performed to account for the effects of tumbling and spin-rotation coupling on the spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times. Concentration effects on the electron saturation are introduced by allowing for Heisenberg spin exchange between two nitroxides. Polarization enhancement profiles, calculated from the computed saturation, are directly compared with liquid-state dynamic nuclear polarization experiments conducted at 260 GHz/400 MHz. The contribution of the separate hyperfine lines to the saturation can be easily disentangled using the developed formalism.},

The growth of the signal enhancement is governed by the rotating frame nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1 rho), which is four orders of magnitude shorter than the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T-ln), Due to the rapid polarization transfer in the nuclear rotating frame the experiment can be recycled at a rate of 1/T-1 rho and is not limited by the much slower lab frame nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T-ln). The increased repetition rate allowed in the nuclear rotating frame provides an effective enhancement per unit time(1/2) of epsilon(t) = 197, The nuclear rotating frame-DNP experiment does not require high microwave power; significant signal enhancements were obtained with a low-power (20 mW) Gunn diode microwave source and no microwave resonant structure. The symmetric trityl radical used as the polarization source is water-soluble and has a narrow EPR linewidth of 10 G at 139.5 GHz making it an ideal polarization source for high-field DNP/NMR studies of biological systems.

abstract = {Comprehensive application of solution NMR spectroscopy to studies of macromolecules remains fundamentally limited by the molecular rotational correlation time. For proteins, molecules larger than 30 kDa require complex experimental methods, such as TROSY in conjunction with isotopic labeling schemes that are often expensive and generally reduce the potential information available. We have developed the reverse micelle encapsulation strategy as an alternative approach. Encapsulation of proteins within the protective nano-scale water pool of a reverse micelle dissolved in ultra-low viscosity nonpolar solvents overcomes the slow tumbling problem presented by large proteins. Here, we characterize the contributions from the various components of the protein-containing reverse micelle system to the rotational correlation time of the encapsulated protein. Importantly, we demonstrate that the protein encapsulated in the reverse micelle maintains a hydration shell comparable in size to that seen in bulk solution. Using moderate pressures, encapsulation in ultra-low viscosity propane or ethane can be used to magnify this advantage. We show that encapsulation in liquid ethane can be used to reduce the tumbling time of the 43 kDa maltose binding protein from \~{}23 to \~{}10 ns. These conditions enable, for example, acquisition of TOCSY-type data resolved on the adjacent amide NH for the 43 kDa encapsulated maltose binding protein dissolved in liquid ethane, which is typically impossible for proteins of such size without use of extensive deuteration or the TROSY effect.},

Utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM), the average height of immobilized calmodulin was determined to be 1.87 ± 0.19 nm. After incubation in EGTA solution, the average height of the protein changed to 2.26 ± 0.21 nm, indicating the conformational change of CaM to Apo-CaM. Immobilized CaM also demonstrated a conformational change upon the reaction with known calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine (CPZ). After incubation in CPZ solution, the average height of CPZ-bound CaM increased to 2.32 ± 0.20 nm, demonstrating that immobilized CaM has a similar response to that in bulk solution. These results show that the immobilization of calmodulin on a solid support does not interfere with the ability of the protein to bind calcium and calmodulin antagonists. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing AFM to probe and understand protein conformational changes.},

abstract = {Many important biochemical processes occur on the time-scales of nanoseconds and microseconds. The introduction of the laser temperature-jump (T-jump) to biophysics more than a decade ago opened these previously inaccessible time regimes up to direct experimental observation. Since then, laser T-jump methodology has evolved into one of the most versatile and generally applicable methods for studying fast biomolecular kinetics. This perspective is a review of the principles and applications of the laser T-jump technique in biophysics. A brief overview of the T-jump relaxation kinetics and the historical development of laser T-jump methodology is presented. The physical principles and practical experimental considerations that are important for the design of the laser T-jump experiments are summarized. These include the Raman conversion for generating heating pulses, considerations of size, duration and uniformity of the temperature jump, as well as potential adverse effects due to photo-acoustic waves, cavitation and thermal lensing, and their elimination. The laser T-jump apparatus developed at the NIH Laboratory of Chemical Physics is described in detail along with a brief survey of other laser T-jump designs in use today. Finally, applications of the laser T-jump in biophysics are reviewed, with an emphasis on the broad range of problems where the laser T-jump methodology has provided important new results and insights into the dynamics of the biomolecular processes.},

Here we extend the technique to a more complex, biologically important system: the homodimeric transmembrane dimer from the $\alpha$ chain of the integrin $\alpha$(IIb)$\beta$(3). We prepared micelle suspensions of the pair of 30-residue chains that span the membrane in the native structure, with varying levels of heavy ((13)C=(18)O) isotopes substituted in the backbone of the central 10th through 20th positions. The constraints derived from vibrational coupling of the precisely spaced heavy residues led to determination of an optimized structure from a range of model candidates: Glycine residues at the 12th, 15th, and 16th positions form a tertiary contact in parallel right-handed helix dimers with crossing angles of -58° ± 9° and interhelical distances of 7.7 ± 0.5 angstroms. The frequency correlation established the dynamical model used in the analysis, and it indicated the absence of mobile water associated with labeled residues. Delocalization of vibrational excitations between the helices was also quantitatively established.},

We demonstrate the capability of this technique by quantifying the permeability of glycine across negatively charged liposomal bilayers composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG). The permeability coefficient of glycine across this DPPC/DPPG bilayer is measured to be (1.8 ± 0.1) × 10(-11)m/s, in agreement with the literature value. We further observed that the presence of 20 mol \% cholesterol within the DPPC/DPPG lipid membrane significantly retards the permeability of glycine by a factor of 4. These findings demonstrate that the high sensitivity and contrast of J-mediated (13)C ODNP affords the measurement of the permeation kinetics of small hydrophilic molecules across lipid bilayers, a quantity that is difficult to accurately measure with existing techniques.},

abstract = {We describe the model dynamical behavior of the solvent between two nanoscopic hydrophobic solutes. The dynamics of the vicinal water in various sized traps is found to be significantly different from bulk behavior. We consider the dynamics at normal temperature and pressure at three intersolute distances corresponding to the three solvent separated minima in the free energy profile between the solutes with attractions. These three states correspond to one, two, and three intervening layers of water molecules. Results are obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation at constant temperature and pressure (NPT) ensemble. Translational diffusion of water molecules trapped between the two solutes has been analyzed from the velocity correlation function as well as from the mean square displacement of the water molecules. The rotational behavior has been analyzed through the reorientational dynamics of the dipole moment vector of the water molecule by calculating both first and second rank dipole-dipole correlation functions. Both the translational and reorientational mobilities of water are found to be much slower at the smaller separation and increases as the separation between solutes becomes larger. The occupation time distribution functions calculated from the trajectories also show that the relaxation is much slower for the smallest intersolute separation as compared to other wider separations. The sublinear trend in mean square displacement and the stretched exponential decay of the relaxation of dipolar correlation and occupation distribution function indicate that the dynamical behavior of water in the confined region between two large hydrophobic solutes departs from usual Brownian behavior. This behavior is reminiscent of the behavior of water in the vicinity of protein surface clefts or trapped between two domains of a protein.},

abstract = {The nitroxyl radical spin probes, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), 4-oxo-TEMPO (TEMPONE) and 4-amino-TEMPO (TEMPAMINE) were examined by continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in a series of cation-exchanged X-type faujasite zeolite supercages. The spectra in Li-X, Na-X and K-X between 10 and 300 K were fitted by varying the rotational correlation constants, the homogeneous linewidth, and the principal nitrogen nuclear hyperfine coupling matrix element (Azz) for the axis near the C-N-C plane normal. The TEMPONE activation energies for rotation, 12.1-3.1 kJ mol-1, decrease monotonically with cation size, suggesting an attractive interaction with the cation that depends on cation Lewis activity. TEMPO and TEMPAMINE have activation energies for rotation, 6.7-12.8 and 2.8-10.0 kJ mol-1, respectively, that increase with cation size, suggesting non-bonded repulsion of the molecules by the cations. We propose that the attraction of the cation to TEMPONE is via its carbonyl [pi] electrons, an interaction found for the larger phenalenyl [pi] systems in previous work (D.C. Doetschman, D.W. Dwyer, J.D. Fox, C.K. Frederick, S. Scull, G.D. Thomas, S.G. Utterback, J. Wei, Chem. Phys. 185 (1994) 343). In contrast, the amino group of TEMPAMINE is sp3 hybridized and has essentially no [pi] character. It is well known from X-ray diffraction studies, in which the NO group is found to project out of the C-N-C plane, and from the magnitude of the Azz nuclear hyperfine coupling element that the NO group has relatively little [pi] character. The activation energies of the TEMPO rotation are consistently larger than those of TEMPAMINE. We propose that the volume of TEMPO is effectively larger than that of TEMPAMINE because TEMPO is undergoing rapid piperidine ring inversion which does not occur in TEMPAMINE. Preliminary pulsed EPR results for TEMPO are presented that appear to indicate a second type of molecular motion associated with the motion with the piperidine ring inversion.},

abstract = {Water molecules at the surface of DNA are critical to its equilibrium structure, DNA-protein function, and DNA-ligand recognition. Here we report direct probing of the dynamics of hydration, with femtosecond resolution, at the surface of a DNA dodecamer duplex whose native structure remains unperturbed on recognition in minor groove binding with the bisbenzimide drug (Hoechst 33258). By following the temporal evolution of fluorescence, we observed two well separated hydration times, 1.4 and 19 ps, whereas in bulk water the same drug is hydrated with time constants of 0.2 and 1.2 ps. For comparison, we also studied calf thymus DNA for which the hydration exhibits similar time scales to that of dodecamer DNA. However, the time-resolved polarization anisotropy is very different for the two types of DNA and clearly elucidates the rigidity in drug binding and difference in DNA rotational motions. These results demonstrate that hydration at the surface of the groove is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories; the slowest of them (approximately 20 ps) are those describing dynamically ordered water. Because of their ultrafast time scale, the "ordered" water molecules are the most weakly bound and are accordingly involved in the entropic (hydration/dehydration) process of recognition.},

The disease-specific amyloid fibrils comprise primarily a single protein, amyloid b, in Alzheimer's disease, and the prion protein in scrapie. These proteins can be induced to form aggregates in vitro that are indistinguishable from brain-derived fibrils. Consequently, much effort has been invested in the development of in vitro model systems to study the details of the aggregation processes and the effects of endogenous mols. that have been implicated in disease. Selected studies of this type are reviewed herein. A simple mechanistic model has emerged for both processes that involves a nucleation-dependent polymn. This mechanism dictates that aggregation is dependent on protein concn. and time. Furthermore, amyloid formation can be seeded by a performed fibril. The physiol. consequences of this mechanism are discussed. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The correlation time (tc) of the probe, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone N-oxide, in the micelle was .apprx.1.2 * 10-9 s, suggesting that the probe was in the polyoxyethylene group. The value did not change greatly with 25-90\% water content, in contrast to the macroscopic properties. The hydration of the group of the surfactant in the micelle is discussed on the basis of tc, the hyperfine coupling const., and the lmax of UV absorption.

abstract = {An analytical model for water and charge transport in highly acidic and highly confined systems such as proton exchange membranes of fuel cells is developed and compared to available experimental data. The model is based on observations from both experiment and multiscale simulation. The model accounts for three factors in the system including acidity, confinement, and connectivity. This model has its basis in the molecular-level mechanisms of water transport but has been coarse-grained to the extent that it can be expressed in an analytical form. The model uses the concentration of H(3)O(+) ion to characterize acidity, interfacial surface area per water molecule to characterize confinement, and percolation theory to describe connectivity. Several important results are presented. First, an integrated multiscale simulation approach including both molecular dynamics simulation and confined random walk theory is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimentally measured self-diffusivities of water in the perfluorinated sulfonic acid proton exchange membrane material, Nafion. The simulations, across a range of hydration conditions from minimally hydrated to fully saturated, have an average error for the self-diffusivity of water of 16\% relative to experiment. Second, accounting for three factors-acidity, confinement, and connectivity-is necessary and sufficient to understand the self-diffusivity of water in proton exchange membranes. Third, an analytical model based on percolation theory is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimentally measured self-diffusivities of both water and charge in Nafion across a full range of hydration.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the application of continuous wave dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at 0.35 T for site-specific water accessibility studies on spin-labeled membrane proteins at concentrations in the 10-100 $\mu$M range. The DNP effects at such low concentrations are weak and the experimentally achievable dynamic nuclear polarizations can be below the equilibrium polarization. This sensitivity problem is solved with an optimized home-built DNP probe head consisting of a dielectric microwave resonator and a saddle coil as close as possible to the sample. The performance of the probe head is demonstrated with both a modified pulsed EPR spectrometer and a dedicated CW EPR spectrometer equipped with a commercial NMR console. In comparison to a commercial pulsed ENDOR resonator, the home-built resonator has an FID detection sensitivity improvement of 2.15 and an electron spin excitation field improvement of 1.2. The reproducibility of the DNP results is tested on the water soluble maltose binding protein MalE of the ABC maltose importer, where we determine a net standard deviation of 9\% in the primary DNP data in the concentration range between 10 and 100 $\mu$M. DNP parameters are measured in a spin-labeled membrane protein, namely the vitamin B(12) importer BtuCD in both detergent-solubilized and reconstituted states. The data obtained in different nucleotide states in the presence and absence of binding protein BtuF reveal the applicability of this technique to qualitatively extract water accessibility changes between different conformations by the ratio of primary DNP parameters ϵ. The ϵ-ratio unveils the physiologically relevant transmembrane communication in the transporter in terms of changes in water accessibility at the cytoplasmic gate of the protein induced by both BtuF binding at the periplasmic region of the transporter and ATP binding at the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains.},

abstract = {Proton spin-lattice relaxation rate changes induced by freely diffusing oxygen in aqueous and mixed solvents are reported for representative amino acids and glucose. The local oxygen concentration at each spectrally resolved proton was deduced from the paramagnetic contribution to the relaxation rate. The measured relaxation increment is compared to that of the force-free diffusion relaxation model, and the differences are related to a free energy for the oxygen association with different portions of the solute molecules. The free energy differences are small, on the order of -800 to -2000 J/mol, but are uniformly negative for all proton positions measured on the amino acids in water and reflect the energetic benefit of weak association of hydrophobic cosolutes. For glucose, CH proton positions report negative free energies for oxygen association, the magnitude of which depends on the solvent; however, the hydroxyl positions report positive free energy differences relative to the force-free diffusion model, which is consistent with partial occupancy in the OH region by a solvent hydrogen bond.},

abstract = {Neutron diffraction is an effective method for investigating model and biological membranes. Yet, to obtain accurate structural information it is necessary to use deuterium labels and much time is needed to acquire experimental data as there are a large number of diffraction reflections to register. This paper offers a way to define the hydrophobic boundary position in lipid membranes with high accuracy and for this purpose it is sufficient to take into consideration three structural factors. The method is based on modeling the density of the neutron diffraction amplitude rho(x) in the direction of the bilayer plane normal by means of a strip function, but it also takes into consideration the fact that the multiplication of the strip function amplitude rho i by the step width zi-zi-1 makes the sum of neutron scattering amplitudes of the atoms included in the step region. On the basis of the analysis of a large number of experimental data for different membranes, the effectiveness of this method in the determination of the position of hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundary is demonstrated, including the case of various rho(x) modifications in the region of polar heads and also the different phase states of membranes. However, it is shown in the present paper that the strip function model is not an adequate instrument for the determination of other structural parameters of membranes.},

abstract = {A method for obtaining strongly polarized nuclear spins in solution has been developed. The method uses low temperature, high magnetic field, and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to strongly polarize nuclear spins in the solid state. The solid sample is subsequently dissolved rapidly in a suitable solvent to create a solution of molecules with hyperpolarized nuclear spins. The polarization is performed in a DNP polarizer, consisting of a super-conducting magnet (3.35 T) and a liquid-helium cooled sample space. The sample is irradiated with microwaves at approximate to94 GHz. Subsequent to polarization, the sample is dissolved by an injection system inside the DNP magnet. The dissolution process effectively preserves the nuclear polarization. The resulting hyperpolarized liquid sample can be transferred to a high-resolution NMR spectrometer, where an enhanced NMR signal can be acquired, or it may be used as an agent for in vivo imaging or spectroscopy. In this article we describe the use of the method on aqueous solutions of [C-13]urea. Polarizations of 37\% for C-13 and 7.8\% for N-15, respectively, were obtained after the dissolution. These polarizations correspond to an enhancement of 44,000 for C-13 and 23,500 for N-15, respectively, compared with thermal equilibrium at 9.4 T and room temperature. The method can be used generally for signal enhancement and reduction of measurement time in liquid-state NMR and opens up for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications of DNP-enhanced NMR.},

abstract = {DNP parameters relevant to Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (OMRI) are reported for a few nitroxyl radicals and their corresponding N-15 and H-2 enriched analogues, used in simultaneous imaging by OMRI. DNP enhancement was measured at 14.529 mT, using a custom-built scanner operating in a field-cycled mode, for different concentrations, ESR irradiation times and RF power levels. DNP enhancements increased with agent concentration up to 2.5 mM and decreased above 3 mM, in tune with ESR line broadening measured at X-band as a function of the agent concentration. The proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1) measured at very low Zeeman field (14.529 mT) and the longitudinal relaxivity parameters were estimated. The relaxivity parameters were in good agreement with those independently computed from the linear region of the concentration dependent enhancement. The leakage factor showed an asymptotic increase with increasing agent concentration. The coupling parameters of N-14- and N-15-labeled carbamoyl-PROXYL showed the interaction between the electron and nuclear spins to be mainly dipolar in origin. Upon H-2 labeling, about 70\% and 40\% increases in enhancement for N-15- and N-14-labeled nitroxyl agents were observed, respectively. It is envisaged that the results reported here may enable better understanding of the factors determining DNP enhancement to design suitable 'beacons' for simultaneous molecular imaging by OMRI.

Depending on the total concn. and the pH, different types of oleic acid/oleate aggregates formed. At the 2 ends of the pH range studied (above pH 10.4 and below pH 6.4), the ESR spectra of 16-DS were highly sym., enabling calcn. of the microviscosities in the surfactant aggregates to be 4 cP and 6 cP, resp. In the high pH range, the obsd. aggregates are micelles. However, in the low pH range the microviscosity was considerably lower than that of neat oleic acid (measured to be 11 cP), indicating that the obtained emulsion system was not composed of pure oleic acid droplets. The authors postulate that the surfactant mols. at low pH form condensed aggregates of lamellar bilayers. Asym. high-field ESR lines were obtained at intermediate pH between pH 6.4 and pH 10.4. This indicates that the probe mols. were present in 2 phys. different aggregation states. The authors assigned the 2 aggregation states to be vesicles and nonlamellar aggregates (most likely nonspherical micelles), based on the observation made by microscopy and light scattering techniques. The anal. of the ESR lines by spectral simulation using a modified Bloch equation supports the coexistence of vesicles and nonlamellar aggregates through the entire intermediate pH range; the relative amt. of the 2 aggregation forms depends critically on pH, temp., and concn. The spectral simulation indicated that particularly stable oleic acid/oleate vesicles are formed around pH 8.5, where the protonated and ionized species exist in a stoichiometric ratio.

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease plays a fundamental role in the maturation and life cycle of the retrovirus HIV-1, as it functions in regulating post-translational processing of the viral polyproteins gag and gag-pol; thus, it is a key target of AIDS antiviral therapy. Accessibility of substrate to the active site is mediated by two flaps, which must undergo a large conformational change from an open to a closed conformation during substrate binding and catalysis. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the conformations of the flaps in apo HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR), subtypes B, C, and F, CRF01\_A/E, and patient isolates V6 and MDR 769. The distance distribution profiles obtained from analysis of the dipolar modulated echo curves were reconstructed to yield a set of Gaussian-shaped populations, which provide an analysis of the flap conformations sampled. The relative percentages of each conformer population described as "tucked/curled", "closed", "semi-open", and "wide-open" were determined and compared for various constructs. The results and analyses show that sequence variations among subtypes, CRFs, and patient isolates of apo HIV-1PR alter the average flap conformation in a way that can be understood as inducing shifts in the relative populations, or conformational sampling, of the previously described four conformations for HIV-1PR.},

abstract = {We modified membrane-active peptides with synthetic recognition modules to foster peptide assembly at the lipid-water interface. The designed recognition strategy has been previously reported: tris-cyanuric acid and tris-melamine have been found to bind selectively to each another when membrane-anchored. We designed this interaction to occur between two membrane-active peptides, forming a heteromeric complex at the lipid-water interface that exhibits superior membrane binding and permeation compared to the monomeric peptides, presumably because of the higher avidity of the assembled structure. These conjugates do not assemble appreciably in solution but assemble at the lipid-water interface, with surface binding of the peptide acting cooperatively with molecular recognition to yield improved binding and permeation. Furthermore, we find that specific recognition between tris-cyanuric acid phospholipid (TCA-PE) at low surface concentration and tris-melamine magainin (TMM) or hexa-melamine magainin (HMM) results in highly lytic binding, whereas no binding is detectable in the absence of lipid recognition. These findings suggest a noncovalent strategy to enhance peptide membrane activity, which may lead to the discovery of more potent surface-active agents such as antimicrobials.},

abstract = {Scientific literature dealing with the rates, mechanisms, and thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions in condensed media almost exclusively assumes that reactions take place in volumes that do not change over time. The reaction volumes are compact (such as a sphere, a cube, or a cylinder) and do not vary in shape. In this review article, we discuss two important systems at small length scales (approximately 10 nm to 5 microm), in which these basic assumptions are violated. The first system exists in cell biology and is represented by the tiniest functional components (i.e., single cells, organelles, and other physically delineated cellular microenvironments). The second system comprises nanofluidic devices, in particular devices made from soft-matter materials such as lipid nanotube-vesicle networks. In these two systems, transport, mixing, and shape changes can be achieved at or very close to thermal energy levels. In further contrast to macroscopic systems, mixing by diffusion is extremely efficient, and kinetics can be controlled by shape and volume changes.},

Several methods as steady-state fluorescence polarization, differential scanning calorimetry, zeta potential, and agglutination have been used to describe the physicochemical outcome of the incorporation of these synthetic glycolipids within phospholipid layers. From calorimetry and fluorescence experiments, it is apparent that the glycolipids decrease the transition temperature of the bilayers in a more important extent than cholesterol. Furthermore, the thickness of the aqueous layer fixed around the liposome is independent of the presence of glycolipids, suggesting that their hydrophilic parts (tetraethyleneglycol spacer and sugar moiety) are not completely extended towards the aqueous phase. Nevertheless, an important and specific interaction has been observed between such glycosylated liposomes and vegetal lectins.},

abstract = {Solid-state NMR signal enhancements of about two orders of magnitude (100-400) have been observed in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments performed at high magnetic field (5 T) and low temperature (10 K) using the nitroxide radical 4-amino TEMPO as the source of electron polarization. Since the breadth of the 4-amino TEMPO EPR spectrum is large compared to the nuclear Larmor frequency, it has been assumed that thermal mixing (TM) is the dominate mechanism by which polarization is transferred from electron to nuclear spins. However, theoretical explanations of TM generally assume a homogeneously broadened EPR line and, since the 4-amino TEMPO line at 5 T is inhomogeneously broadened, they do not explain the observed DNP enhancements. Accordingly, we have developed a treatment of DNP that explicitly uses electron-electron cross-relaxation to mediate electron-nuclear polarization transfer. The process proceeds via spin flip-flops between pairs of electronic spin packets whose Zeeman temperatures differ from one another. To confirm the essential features of the model we have studied the field dependence of electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) data and DNP enhancement data. Both are well simulated using a simple model of electron cross-relaxation in the inhomogeneously broadened 4-amino TEMPO EPR line. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Nesmelov2006,
abstract = {We have performed calculations, verified by experiment, to explain why the sensitivity of biological EPR can be dramatically increased by dividing the aqueous sample into separate compartments. In biological EPR, the major factor affecting sensitivity is the number of spins in the sample. For an aqueous sample at ambient temperature, this is limited by the requirement for a small volume, due to strong non-resonant absorption of microwaves by water. However, recent empirical studies have shown that this volume limitation can be greatly relieved by dividing the aqueous sample into separate volumes, which allows much more aqueous sample to be loaded into a resonant cavity without significant degradation of the cavity quality factor. Calculations, based on the Bruggeman mixing rule, show quantitatively that the composite aqueous sample has a permittivity much less than that of bulk water, depending on the aqueous volume fraction f. Analysis for X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that the optimal volume fraction of an aqueous composite sample, producing maximum sensitivity, is f=0.15, increasing the sensitivity by a factor of 8.7, compared with an aqueous sample in a single tube.},

abstract = {Most of the decisive molecular events in biology take place at the protein-water interface. The dynamical properties of the hydration layer are therefore of fundamental importance. To characterize the dynamical heterogeneity and rotational activation energy in the hydration layer, we measured the (17)O spin relaxation rate in dilute solutions of three proteins in a wide temperature range extending down to 238 K. We find that the rotational correlation time can be described by a power-law distribution with exponent 2.1-2.3. Except for a small fraction of secluded hydration sites, the dynamic perturbation in the hydration layer is the same for all proteins and does not differ in any essential way from the hydration shell of small organic solutes. In both cases, the dynamic perturbation factor is <2 at room temperature and exhibits a maximum near 262 K. This maximum implies that, at low temperatures, the rate of water molecule rotation has a weaker temperature dependence in the hydration layer than in bulk water. We attribute this difference to the temperature-independent constraints that the protein surface imposes on the water H-bond network. The free hydration layer studied here differs qualitatively from confined water in solid protein powder samples.},

abstract = {Slow micros/ms dynamics involved in protein folding, binding, catalysis, and allostery are currently detected using NMR dispersion experiments such as CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) or spin-lock R(1rho). In these methods, protein dynamics are obtained by analyzing relaxation dispersion curves obtained from either changing the time spacing between 180 degree pulses or by changing the effective spin-locking field strength. In this Communication, we introduce a new method to induce a dispersion of relaxation rates. Our approach relies on altering the shape of the adiabatic full passage pulse and is conceptually different from existing approaches. By changing the nature of the adiabatic radiofrequency irradiation, we are able to obtain rotating frame R(1rho) and R(2rho) dispersion curves that are sensitive to slow micros/ms protein dynamics (demonstrated with ubiquitin). The strengths of this method are to (a) extend the dynamic range of the relaxation dispersion analysis, (b) avoid the need for multiple magnetic field strengths to extract dynamic parameters, (c) measure accurate relaxation rates that are independent of frequency offset, and (d) reduce the stress to NMR hardware (e.g., cryoprobes).},

abstract = {An understanding of cellular chemistry requires knowledge of how crowded environments affect proteins. The influence of crowding on protein stability arises from two phenomena, hard-core repulsions and soft (i.e., chemical) interactions. Most efforts to understand crowding effects on protein stability, however, focus on hard-core repulsions, which are inherently entropic and stabilizing. We assessed these phenomena by measuring the temperature dependence of NMR-detected amide proton exchange and used these data to extract the entropic and enthalpic contributions of crowding to the stability of ubiquitin. Contrary to expectations, the contribution of chemical interactions is large and in many cases dominates the contribution from hardcore repulsions. Our results show that both chemical interactions and hard-core repulsions must be considered when assessing the effects of crowding and help explain previous observations about protein stability and dynamics in cells.},

abstract = {The study of intermolecular collisions and bonding interactions in solutions is of critical importance in understanding and predicting solute/solvent properties. Previous work has established that stable paramagnetic nitroxide molecules are excellent probes of intermolecular interactions for hydrogen bonding in polar solvents. In this study, 1H, 2H, 13C, 15N NMR and liquid/liquid intermolecular transfer dynamic nuclear polarization (L2IT DNP) results are obtained for the paramagnetic probe molecule, TEMPO, interacting with the common aprotic and protic polar solvents, CH3CN and CH3CONH2, yielding a profile of both dipolar and scalar interactions. A significant scalar contact hyperfine is observed for the N-O...H-C interaction (13CH3 hyperfine, a/h=0.66 MHz) in the CH3CN/TEMPO system, whereas the N-O...H-C and N-O...H-N interactions for the TEMPO/CH3CONH2 system yield 13CH3 and 15N hyperfine couplings of a/h=0.16 and -0.50 MHz, respectively. The distance and attitude of the scalar interaction for the nitroxide hydrogen bonding at the methyl group in CH3CN and the amino group in CH3CONH2 are computed using density functional theory (DFT), yielding good agreement with the experimental results. These results show that the hyperfine coupling provides a sensitive probe of weak hydrogen-bonding interactions in solution.},

abstract = {In site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), local structural and dynamic information is obtained via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of a stable nitroxide radical attached site-specifically to a macromolecule. Analysis of electron spin dipolar interactions between pairs of nitroxides yields the inter-nitroxide distance, which provides quantitative structural information. The development of pulse EPR methods has enabled such distance measurements up to 70 A in bio-molecules, thus opening up the possibility of SDSL global structural mapping. This study evaluates SDSL distance measurement using a nitroxide (designated as R5) that can be attached, in an efficient and cost-effective manner, to a phosphorothioate backbone position at arbitrary DNA or RNA sequences. R5 pairs were attached to selected positions of a dodecamer DNA duplex with a known NMR structure, and eight distances, ranging from 20 to 40 A, were measured using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The measured distances correlated strongly (R2 = 0.98) with the predicted values calculated based on a search of sterically allowable R5 conformations in the NMR structure, thus demonstrating accurate distance measurements using R5. Furthermore, distance measurement in a 42 kD DNA was demonstrated. The results establish R5 as a sequence-independent probe for global structural mapping of DNA and DNA-protein complexes.},

Photoconductivity transients, resulting from the formation of mobile, conduction band electrons in the semiconductor have been measured on excitation with 3 ns pulses of UV (300 nm) and visible (410-700 nm) light. The product of the yield of formation of mobile charge carriers, phi, and the sum of their mobilities, Sigmamicro, has been determined from the maximum conductivity for light intensities varying from approximately 10(12) to approximately 10(16) photons/cm(2)/pulse. For the bare nc-TiO(2) layer at 300 nm and the coated layer at all wavelengths, phiSigmamicro initially increased with increasing intensity, reached a maximum, and eventually decreased at high intensities. The initial increase is attributed to the gradual filling of (surface) electron trapping sites. This effect was absent when the samples were continuously illuminated with background irradiation at 300 nm with an intensity of 6 x 10(13) photons/cm(2)/s (40 microW/cm(2)), thereby presaturating the trapping sites prior to the laser pulse. The trap-free mobility of electrons within these 9 nm nanoparticles is estimated to be 0.034 cm(2)/Vs at 9 GHz. The eventual decrease in phiSigmamicro at intensities corresponding to an electron occupancy of more than one electron per particle is unaffected by background illumination, and is attributed to a decrease in micro due to electron-electron interactions within the semiconductor particles. The photoconductivity action spectrum of the coated nc-TiO(2) layer closely followed the photon attenuation spectrum in the visible of the porphyrin, with a charge separation efficiency per absorbed photon of 18\% at the Soret band maximum. The after-pulse decay of the photoconductivity showed a power law behavior over a time scale of nanoseconds to several hundreds of microseconds, which is attributed to multiple trapping and detrapping events at chemical or physical defects within the semiconductor matrix.},

Under these conditions the water proton relaxation rate is determined by the magnetic coupling between the water protons and the paramagnetic nitroxide fixed on the phospholipid. This coupling is made time-dependent by the relative translational motion of the water proton spins past the nitroxide radical. Using theories developed by Freed and others, we interpret the NMR relaxation data in terms of localized water translational motion and find that the translational diffusion constant for water within approximately 10 A of the phospholipid surface is 6 x 10(-10) m2 s(-1) at 298 K. Similar results are obtained for three different nitroxide labels positioned at different points on the lipid. The diffusion is a thermally activated process with an activation energy only slightly higher than that for bulk water.},

abstract = {Despite their immense importance to cellular function, the precise mechanism by which chaperonins aid in the folding of other proteins remains unknown. Experimental evidence seems to imply that there is some diversity in how chaperonins interact with their substrates and this has led to a number of different models for chaperonin mechanism. Computational methods have the advantage of accessing temporal and spatial resolutions that are difficult for experimental techniques; therefore, these methods have been applied to this problem for some time. Here we review the relevant computational models for chaperonin function. We propose that these models need not be mutually exclusive and in fact can be thought of as a set of tools the chaperonin may use to aid in the folding of a diverse array of substrate proteins. We conclude with a discussion of the role of water in the chaperonin mechanism, a factor that until recently has been largely neglected by most computational studies of chaperonin function.},

abstract = {We present a generally applicable approach for monitoring protein aggregation by detecting changes in surface hydration water dynamics and the changes in solvent accessibility of specific protein sites, as protein aggregation proceeds in solution state. This is made possible through the Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of water interacting with stable nitroxide spin labels tethered to specific proteins sites. This effect is highly localized due to the magnetic dipolar nature of the electron-proton spin interaction, with >80\% of their interaction occurring within 5 A between the unpaired electron of the spin label and the proton of water. We showcase our tool on the aggregation of tau proteins, whose fibrillization is linked to neurodegenerative disease pathologies known as taupathies. We demonstrate that the DNP approach to monitor local changes in hydration dynamics with residue specificity and local contrast can distinguish specific and neat protein-protein packing leading to fibers from non-specific protein agglomeration or precipitation. The ability to monitor tau assembly with local, residue-specific, resolution, under ambient conditions and in solution state will help unravel the mechanism and structural characteristics of the gradual process of tau aggregation into amyloid fibers, which remains unclear to this day.},

abstract = {The specific binding sites of Hofmeister ions with an uncharged 600-residue elastin-like polypeptide, (VPGVG)(120), were elucidated using a combination of NMR and thermodynamic measurements along with molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that the large soft anions such as SCN(-) and I(-) interact with the polypeptide backbone via a hybrid binding site that consists of the amide nitrogen and the adjacent $\alpha$-carbon. The hydrocarbon groups at these sites bear a slight positive charge, which enhances anion binding without disrupting specific hydrogen bonds to water molecules. The hydrophobic side chains do not contribute significantly to anion binding or the corresponding salting-in behavior of the biopolymer. Cl(-) binds far more weakly to the amide nitrogen/$\alpha$-carbon binding site, while SO(4)(2-) is repelled from both the backbone and hydrophobic side chains of the polypeptide. The Na(+) counterions are also repelled from the polypeptide. The identification of these molecular-level binding sites provides new insights into the mechanism of peptide-anion interactions.},

The low-voltage operating mode provides a path to further miniaturization of the gyrotron through reduction in the size of the electron gun, power supply, collector, and cooling system, which will benefit industrial and scientific applications requiring portability. Detailed studies of low-voltage operation in the TE2,3,1 mode reveal that the mode can be excited with less than 7 W of beam power at 3.5 kV. During CW operation with 3.5-kV beam voltage and 50-mA beam current, the gyrotron generates 12 W of RF power at 233.2 GHz. The EGUN electron optics code describes the low-voltage operation of the electron gun. Using gun-operating parameters derived from EGUN simulations, we show that a linear theory adequately predicts the low experimental starting currents.},

The drive behind NMR imaging has primarily been in the area of whole-body imaging, which has been limited clinically to fields of up to 1.5 T (60 MHz). It is recognized that there may be substantial advantages in obtaining images with sub-millimetre spatial resolution. Also, there may be benefits to imaging at higher fields, since the signal increases as the square of the magnetic field. Using a modified 9.5 T 89-mm-bore high-resolution NMR spectrometer, we have now obtained the first NMR images of a single cell, demonstrating the advent of the NMR imaging microscope. The NMR microscope is expected to have considerable impact in the areas of biology, medicine and materials science, and may serve as a precursor to obtaining such resolutions on human subjects.},

abstract = {The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCII) of the photosynthetic apparatus in plants self-organizes in vitro. The recombinant apoprotein, denatured in dodecyl sulfate, spontaneously folds when it is mixed with its pigments, chlorophylls, and carotenoids in detergent solution, and assembles into structurally authentic LHCII in the course of several minutes. Pulse EPR techniques, specifically double-electron-electron resonance (DEER), have been used to analyze protein folding during this process. Pairs of nitroxide labels were introduced site-specifically into recombinant LHCII and shown not to affect the stability and function of the pigment-protein complex. Interspin distance distributions between two spin pairs were measured at various time points, one pair located on either end of the second transmembrane helix (helix 3), the other one located near the luminal ends of the intertwined transmembrane helices 1 and 4. In the dodecyl sulfate-solubilized apoprotein, both distance distributions were consistent with a random-coil protein structure. A rapid freeze-quench experiment on the latter spin pair indicated that 1 s after initiating reconstitution the protein structure is virtually unchanged. Subsequently, both distance distributions monitored protein folding in the same time range in which the assembly of chlorophylls into the complex had been observed. The positioning of the spin pair spanning the hydrophobic core of LHCII clearly preceded the juxtaposition of the spin pair on the luminal side of the complex. This indicates that superhelix formation of helices 1 and 4 is a late step in LHCII assembly.},

abstract = {The use of various binitroxides, with both radical sites of similar reactivity, as mediator in the controlled radical polymn. of styrene was examd. and the rate consts. of the reactions involved were detd. at 130 DegC. Typical features of a controlled radical polymn. were obsd. in the early stage of the polymn., leading to the formation of two-arm macromols. contg. the binitroxide at the core. At higher conversion, however, continuous decompn. reaction resulted in a break of the two-arm macromols. into a dead chain having an unsatn. end group and a living chain capped by a modified binitroxide. The latter had the free nitroxide site inactivated by conversion into hydroxylamine. The extent of this side reaction was much larger than in classical nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymn. of styrene. This feature was assigned to the structure of the growing chains. As they contain the binitroxide at the core, the activation reaction produces a propagating chain and a nitroxide to which another polymeric chain remains attached by the second alkoxyamine bond. Thus, deactivation of the propagating radical by nitroxide is a bimol. process between two macromol. species. This unique situation had no significant effect on the rate const. of the alkoxyamine homolytic dissocn., but more importantly decreased the rate const. of recombination. The latter was 30 times lower than that detd. for the recombination of TEMPO with polystyryl radical at 130 DegC. The slow recombination was assigned to steric hindrance and resulted in an unusually high concn. of nitroxide in the polymn. medium, together with a large concn. of propagating radicals. A consequence of the high concn. of both radicals was the enhanced rate of hydrogen transfer from the active species to the persistent radical, leading to alkoxyamine bond breaking and, hence, to arm sepn.

@article{Halle2009,
abstract = {NMR relaxation experiments have provided a wealth of information about molecular motions in macromolecules and ordered fluids. Even though a rigorous theory of spin relaxation is available, the complexity of the investigated systems often makes the interpretation of limited datasets challenging and ambiguous. To allow physically meaningful information to be extracted from the data without commitment to detailed dynamical models, several versions of a model-free (MF) approach to data analysis have been developed. During the past 2 decades, the MF approach has been used in the vast majority of all NMR relaxation studies of internal motions in proteins and other macromolecules, and it has also played an important role in studies of colloidal systems. Although the MF approach has been almost universally adopted, substantial disagreement remains about its physical foundations and range of validity. It is our aim here to clarify these issues. To this end, we first present rigorous derivations of the three well-known MF formulas for the time correlation function relevant for isotropic solutions. These derivations are more general than the original ones, thereby substantially extending the range of validity of the MF approach. We point out several common misconceptions and explain the physical significance of the approximations involved. In particular, we discuss symmetry requirements and the dynamical decoupling approximation that plays a key role in the MF approach. We also derive a new MF formula, applicable to anisotropic fluids and solids, including microcrystalline protein samples. The so-called slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model has been advanced as an alternative to the MF approach that does not require dynamical decoupling of internal and global motions. To resolve the existing controversy about the relative merits of the SRLS model and the MF approach, we formulate and solve a planar version of the SRLS model. The analytical solution of this model reveals the unphysical consequences of the symmetrical two-body Smoluchowski equation as applied to protein dynamics, thus refuting the widely held belief that the SRLS model is more accurate than the MF approach. The different results obtained by analyzing data with these two approaches therefore do not indicate the importance of dynamical coupling between internal and global motions. Finally, we explore the two principal mechanisms of dynamical coupling in proteins: torque-mediated and friction-mediated coupling. We argue by way of specific analytically solvable models that torque-mediated coupling (which the SRLS model attempts to capture) is unimportant because the relatively slow internal motions that might couple to the global motion tend to be intermittent (jumplike) in character, whereas friction-mediated coupling (which neither the SRLS model nor the MF approach incorporates) may be important for proteins with unstructured parts or flexibly connected domains.},

Through comparison with molecular simulation, we show that our model captures the length-scale and curvature dependence of solvation free energies with near-quantitative accuracy and two to three orders of magnitude less computational effort, and further, correctly describes the large but rare solvent fluctuations that are involved in dewetting, vapor tube formation and hydrophobic assembly. Our model is intermediate in detail and complexity between implicit-solvent models and explicit-water simulations.},

abstract = {Proteins and other macromolecules can act as molecular machines that convert energy from one form to another through cycles of conformational transitions. In a macroscopically fluctuating environment or at the single-molecule level, the probability for a molecule to be in any state j fluctuates, and the probability current from any other state i to state j is given as the sum of a steady-state current and a pumped current, I(ij)=I(ss)(ij)+F(ij)dP(j)/dt, where F(ij) is the fraction of the fluctuating current into and out of state j coming directly from state i, and dP(j)/dt is the rate of change of the probability for the molecule to be in state j. If the fluctuations arise from an equilibrium source, microscopic reversibility guarantees that the time average of the pumped current is zero. If, however, the fluctuations arise due to the action of a nonequilibrium source, the time average of the pumped current is not in general zero and can be opposite in sign to the steady-state current. The pumped current provides a mechanism by which fluctuations, whether generated externally or arising from an internal nonequilibrium chemical reaction, can do electrical, mechanical, or chemical work on a system by coupling into the equilibrium conformational transitions of a protein. In this review I examine work elaborating the mechanism of stochastic pumping and also discuss a thermodynamically consistent approach for modeling the effects of dynamic disorder on enzymes and other proteins.},

Lithium (Li+) was chosen because it is an efficient treatment for manic-depressive illness, with an unknown action mechanism. After having recalled the theoretical basis of a three-spin system comprising, two nuclei-the water proton of the solvent, the dissolved Li+ ion and the free electron of a free radical-we have developed a transient solution in order to optimize potential biological applications of Li DNP. The three-spin model has allowed computation of all the parameters of the system-the longitudinal relaxation rate per unit of free radical concentration, the dipolar and scalar part of the coupling between the nuclei and the electron, and the maximum signal enhancement achievable for both proton and lithium spins. All these measurements have been obtained solely through the detection of the proton resonance.},

abstract = {The absolute perfusion and the intracapillary or regional blood volume (RBV) in murine myocardium were assessed in vivo by spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Pixel-based perfusion and RBV maps were calculated at a pixel resolution of 469 x 469 mum and a slice thickness of 2 mm. The T(1) imaging module was a segmented inversion recovery snapshot fast low angle shot sequence with velocity compensation in all three gradient directions. The group average myocardial perfusion at baseline was determined to be 701 +/- 53 mL (100 g . min)(-1) for anesthesia with isoflurane (N = 11) at a mean heart rate (HR) of 455 +/- 10 beats per minute (bpm). This value is in good agreement with perfusion values determined by invasive microspheres examinations. For i.v. administration of the anesthetic Propofol, the baseline perfusion decreased to 383 +/- 40 mL (100 g . min)(-1) (N = 17, P < 0.05 versus. isoflurane) at a mean heart rate of 261 +/- 13 bpm (P < 0.05 versus isoflurane). In addition, six mice with myocardial infarction were studied under isoflurane anesthesia (HR 397 +/- 7 bpm). The perfusion maps showed a clear decrease of the perfusion in the infarcted area. The perfusion in the remote myocardium decreased significantly to 476 +/- 81 mL (100 g . min)(-1) (P < 0.05 versus sham). Regarding the regional blood volume, a mean value of 11.8 +/- 0.8 vol \% was determined for healthy murine myocardium under anesthesia with Propofol (N = 4, HR 233 +/- 17 bpm). In total, the presented techniques provide noninvasive in vivo assessment of the perfusion and the regional blood volume in the murine myocardium for the first time and seem to be promising tools for the characterization of mouse models in cardiovascular research.

abstract = {Efficient protein folding implies a microscopic funnel-like multidimensional free-energy landscape. Macroscopically, conformational entropy reduction can manifest itself as part of an empirical barrier in the traditional view of folding, but experiments show that such barriers can also entail significant unfavorable enthalpy changes. This observation raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy, that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large uphill moves and thus the multidimensional free-energy landscape may not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume, is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy, netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier. Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step.},

The FST is clearly inferred from the T dependence of the inverse of the self-diffusion coefficient of water (1D) as a crossover point from a non-Arrhenius to an Arrhenius behavior. The combination of the measured self-diffusion coefficient D and the average translational relaxation time tau(T), as measured by neutron scattering, shows the predicted breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in deeply supercooled water.},

abstract = {Nitroxide free radicals are the most commonly used source for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and are also exclusively employed as spin labels for electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of diamagnetic molecules and materials. Nitroxide free radicals have been shown to have strong dipolar coupling to (1)H in water, and thus result in large DNP enhancement of (1)H NMR signal via the well known Overhauser effect. The fundamental parameter in a DNP experiment is the coupling factor, since it ultimately determines the maximum NMR signal enhancements which can be achieved. Despite their widespread use, measurements of the coupling factor of nitroxide free radicals have been inconsistent, and current models have failed to successfully explain our experimental data. We found that the inconsistency in determining the coupling factor arises from not taking into account the characteristics of the ESR transitions, which are split into three (or two) lines due to the hyperfine coupling of the electron to the (14)N nuclei (or (15)N) of the nitric oxide radical. Both intermolecular Heisenberg spin exchange interactions as well as intramolecular nitrogen nuclear spin relaxation mix the three (or two) ESR transitions. However, neither effect has been taken into account in any experimental studies on utilizing or quantifying the Overhauser driven DNP effects. The expected effect of Heisenberg spin exchange on Overhauser enhancements has already been theoretically predicted and observed by Bates and Drozdoski [J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4038 (1977)]. Here, we present a new model for quantifying Overhauser enhancements through nitroxide free radicals that includes both effects on mixing the ESR hyperfine states. This model predicts the maximum saturation factor to be considerably higher by the effect of nitrogen nuclear spin relaxation. Because intramolecular nitrogen spin relaxation is independent of the nitroxide concentration, this effect is still significant at low radical concentrations where electron spin exchange is negligible. This implies that the only correct way to determine the coupling factor of nitroxide free radicals is to measure the maximum enhancement at different concentrations and extrapolate the results to infinite concentration. We verify our model with a series of DNP experimental studies on (1)H NMR signal enhancement of water by means of (14)N as well as (15)N isotope enriched nitroxide radicals.},

abstract = {Proteins of the proteorhodopsin (PR) family are found abundantly in many marine bacteria in the photic zone of the oceans. They are colour-tuned to their environment. The green absorbing species has been shown to act as a light-driven proton pump and thus could form a potential source of energy. The pK(a) of the primary proton acceptor is close to the pH of seawater which could also indicate a regulatory role. Here, we review and summarize our own recent findings in the context of known data and present some new results. Proton transfer in vitro by PR is shown by a fluorescence assay which confirms a pH dependent vectoriality. Previously reported low diffracting 2D crystal preparations of PR are assessed for their use for solid-state NMR by two dimensional (13)C-(13)C DARR spectra. (15)N-(1)H HETCOR MAS NMR experiments show bound water in the vicinity of the protonated Schiff base which could play a role in proton transfer. The effect of highly conserved H75 onto the properties of the chromophore has been investigated by single site mutations. They do show a pronounced effect onto the optical absorption maximum and the pK(a) of the proton acceptor but have only a small effect onto the (15)N chemical shifts of the protonated Schiff base.},

PEO becomes dominant in detg. morphol., and the LC phase is not detected. The cryst. conformation of PEO induces LC moieties to pack more closely, and the two LC layers gradually merge into a single LC layer in the repeating lamellar structure.

@article{Marble2005,
abstract = {Traditionally, unilateral NMR systems such as the NMR-MOUSE have used the fringe field between two bar magnets joined with a yoke in a 'U' geometry. This allows NMR signals to be acquired from a sensitive volume displaced from the magnets, permitting large samples to be investigated. The drawback of this approach is that the static field (B0) generated in this configuration is inhomogeneous, and has a large, nonlinear, gradient. As a consequence, the sensitive volume of the instrument is both small and ill defined. Empirical redesign of the permanent magnet array producing the B0 field has yielded instruments with magnetic field topologies acceptable for varying applications. The drawback of current approaches is the lack of formalism in the control of B0. Rather than tailoring the magnet geometry to NMR investigations, measurements must be tailored to the available magnet geometry. In this work, we present a design procedure whereby the size, shape, field strength, homogeneity, and gradients in the sensitive spot of a unilateral NMR sensor can be controlled. Our design uses high permeability pole pieces, shaped according to the contours of an analytical expression, to control B0, allowing unilateral NMR instruments to be designed to generate a controlled static field topology. We discuss the approach in the context of previously published design techniques, and explain the advantages inherent in our strategy as compared to other optimization methods. We detail the design, simulation, and construction of a unilateral magnet array using our approach. It is shown that the fabricated array exhibits a B0 topology consistent with the design. The utility of the design is demonstrated in a sample nondestructive testing application. Our design methodology is general, and defines a class of unilateral permanent magnet arrays in which the strength and shape of B0 within the sensitive volume can be controlled.},

The distance between the 20th and the 35th cysteine was estimated in doubly spin labeled human ubiquitin. Pulsed DEER requires two microwave sources. However, a phase cycle is not usually required in this method. On the other hand, DQC-ESR at X-band ( approximately 9GHz) can acquire a large echo signal by using pulses of short duration and high power, but this method has an ESEEM (electron spin echo envelope modulation) problem.

Measurements of time-dependent collection of 12 kilobase pair plasmid DNA onto microelectrodes by dielectrophoresis show significant reduction in the response as the frequency increases from 100 kHz to 20 MHz. Collection time profiles are quantitatively measured using fluorescence microscopy over the range 100 kHz to 5 MHz and are represented in terms of two parameters: the initial dielectrophoretic collection rate, and the initial to steady-state collection transition. Measured values for both parameters are consistent with trends in the frequency-dependent real part of the effective polarizability measured for the same plasmid DNA using dielectric spectroscopy. The experimentally measured parameters are qualitatively compared with trends predicted by theory that takes into account dielectrophoretic particle movement and diffusion. The differences between experiment and theory are discussed with suggested improvements to theoretical models, for example, including the effects of electrohydrodynamically driven fluid motion.},

abstract = {"Hot spots" are residues accounting for the majority of the protein-protein binding free energy (BFE) despite that they comprise only a small fraction of the protein-protein interface. A hot spot can be found experimentally by measuring the BFE change upon mutating it to alanine: the mutation gives rise to a significantly large increase in the BFE. Theoretical prediction of hot spots is an enthusiastic subject in biophysics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics. For the development of a reliable prediction method, it is essential to understand the physical origin of hot spots. To this end, we calculate the water-entropy gains upon binding both for a wild-type complex and for its mutant complex using a hybrid method of the angle-dependent integral equation theory applied to a molecular model for water and the morphometric approach. We note that this type of calculation has never been employed in the previously reported methods. The BFE change due to alanine mutation is evaluated only from the change in the water-entropy gain with no parameters fitted to the experimental data. It is shown that the overall performance of predicting hot spots in our method is higher than that in Robetta, a standard free-energy-based method using fitting parameters, when the most widely used criterion for defining an actual hot spot is adopted. This result strongly suggests that the water-entropy effect we calculate is the key factor governing basic physics of hot spots.},

abstract = {A new experimental technique has been developed to measure directly the rotational rate of a molecule connecting two portions of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum, by a method which is independent of any factors in the Hamiltonian (such as A or g tensors) or the particular mechanisms of relaxation. Perdeuterated [N-15] TEMPOL and CTPO in glycerol-water mixtures and spin-labeled hemoglobin were studied using the time domain technique of pulsed saturation recovery electron double resonance (SR-ELDOR) in the 0.1-10-mus motional time regime. The signal from the SR-EPR experiment (in which the pump and observer frequencies are the same) consists of a multiexponential decay, the amplitudes of all of the components being of the same sign. The SR-ELDOR technique of pumping one spin manifold or orientation and observing at another changes the sign of the amplitude of one or more of the components of the decay. The electron spin lattice relaxation rate (T1e-1), the nitrogen nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (T1n-1), and the characteristic rotational correlation rate (tau(R)-1) are measured directly, and independently, using a multicomponent exponential global analysis method. It was not possible, in general, to separate the three desired rates from one another with SR-EPR experiments alone. Pooling the SR-EPR and SR-ELDOR decay curves spectra was essential for success.},

abstract = {The interactions between proteins and solvent components have been investigated for the sucrose/water system. Thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of the thermal unfolding of alpha-chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease were performed as a function of sucrose concentration. The alteration in protein-solvent interactions in the presence of sucrose was also studied by density measurements and analyzed by multicomponent thermodynamic theory. Sucrose does not induce a conformational change in three proteins studied, although it does induce a small change in the circular dichroism spectrum of ribonuclease. The enthalpy of thermal unfolding shows little dependence on the concentration of sucrose, while the apparent activation energy of the unfolding process is increased by the addition of sucrose. The results from the protein-solvent interaction study indicate that sucrose is preferentially excluded from the protein domain, increasing the free energy of the system. Thermodynamically this leads to protein stabilization since the unfolded state of the protein becomes thermodynamically even less favorable in the presence of sucrose. The exclusion of sucrose from the protein domain seems to be related to the higher cohesive force of the sucrose water solvent system since all the experimental observations can be correlated with the effect of sucrose on the surface tension of water.},

abstract = {Pure water in a highly H-1 spin-polarized state is proposed as a contrast-agent-free contrast agent to visualize its macroscopic evolution in aqueous media by MRI. Remotely enhanced liquids for image contrast (RELIC) utilizes a H-1 signal of water that is enhanced outside the sample in continuous-flow mode and immediately delivered to the sample to obtain maximum contrast between entering and bulk fluids. Hyperpolarization suggests an ideal contrast mechanism to highlight the ubiquitous and specific function of water in physiology, biology, and materials because the physiological, chemical, and macroscopic function of water is not altered by the degree of magnetization. We present an approach that is capable of instantaneously enhancing the H-1 MR1 signal by up to 2 orders of magnitude through the overhauser effect under ambient conditions at 0.35 tesla by using highly spin-polarized unpaired electrons that are covalently immobilized onto a porous, water-saturated gel matrix. The continuous polarization of radical free flowing water allowed us to distinctively visualize vortices in model reactors and dispersion patterns through porous media. A H-1 signal enhancement of water by a factor of -10 and -100 provides for an observation time of > 4 and 7 s, respectively, upon its injection into fluids with a T-1 relaxation time of > 1.5 s. The implications for chemical engineering or biomedical applications of using hyperpolarized solvents or physiological fluids to visualize mass transport and perfusion with high and authentic MRI contrast originating from water itself, and not from foreign contrast agents, are immediate.},

The technique has been used to study copper complexes, hemes, enzyme mechanisms, micellar water content, and water permeation profiles in membranes, among other applications. In the present study, we combine ESEEM spectroscopy with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and X-ray crystallography in order to evaluate the technique's potential as a structural tool to describe the native environment of membrane proteins. Using the KcsA potassium channel as a model system, we demonstrate that deuterium ESEEM can detect water permeation along the lipid-exposed surface of the KcsA outer helix. We further demonstrate that (31)P ESEEM is able to identify channel residues that interact with the phosphate headgroup of the lipid bilayer. In combination with X-ray crystallography, the (31)P data may be used to define the phosphate interaction surface of the protein. The results presented here establish ESEEM as a highly informative technique for SDSL studies of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {We describe and demonstrate a system to generate hyperpolarized water in the 0.35 T fringe field of a clinical 1.5 T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet. Once generated, the hyperpolarized water is quickly and continuously transferred from the 0.35 T fringe to the 1.5 T center field of the same magnet for image acquisition using standard MRI equipment. The hyperpolarization is based on Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which effectively and quickly transfers the higher spin polarization of free radicals to nuclear spins at ambient temperatures. We visualize the dispersion of hyperpolarized water as it flows through water-saturated systems by utilizing an observed -15-fold DNP signal enhancement with respect to the unenhanced (1)H MRI signal of water at 1.5 T. The experimental DNP apparatus presented here is readily portable and can be brought to and used with any conventional unshielded MRI system. A new method of immobilizing radicals to gel beads via polyelectrolyte linker arms is described, which led to superior flow Overhauser DNP performance compared to previously presented gels. We discuss the general applicability of Overhauser DNP of water and aqueous solutions in the fringe field of commercially available magnets with central fields up to 4.7 T.},

abstract = {Surfactants are known to stabilize proteins and are often employed as additives in protein formulations. We have developed a method to study the interaction of these formulation additives with proteins by using the partitioning behavior of a spin label. In protein-free formulations, 16-doxyl stearic acid partitions into micelles above the crit. micelle concn. (CMC) of the surfactant and gives rise to composite ESR spectra compared to spectra from $\backslash$"free$\backslash$" label and $\backslash$"rotationally hinder$\backslash$" label. We compute the fraction of micelle-assocd. label by factor anal. and generate a label partition curve. When protein is added to the formulation, surfactant-protein aggregates form at concns. below the surfactant's CMC. Partitioning of the label into these aggregates causes the EPR spectrum to reflect hindered rotation of the label at lower surfactant concns. than in the protein-free solns. A simple model of labeling partitioning shows that these partitioning shifts can be correlated to the surfactant:protein binding stoichiometry. We have studied the interactions of various non-ionic surfactants like Brij and Tween with recombinant human growth hormone and recombinant human interferon-g and obtained corresponding binding stoichiometries. These binding stoichiometries match those obtained by other techniques. This technique offers a new method for estg. the protein:surfactant binding stoichiometries. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Hydration shells of normal proteins display regions of highly structured water as well as patches of less structured bulk-like water. Recent studies suggest that isomers with larger surface densities of patches of bulk-like water have an increased propensity to aggregate. These aggregates are toxic to the cellular environment. Hence, the early detection of these toxic deposits is of paramount medical importance. We show that various morphological states of association of such isomers can be differentiated from the normal protein background based on the characteristic partition between bulk, caged, and surface hydration water and the magnetic resonance (MR) signals of this water. We derive simple mathematical equations relating the compartmentalization of water to the local hydration fraction and the packing density of the newly formed molecular assemblies. Then, we employ these equations to predict the MR response of water constrained by protein aggregation. Our results indicate that single units and compact aggregates that contain no water between constituents induce a shift of the MR signal from normal protein background to values in the hyperintensity domain (bright spots), corresponding to bulk water. In contrast, large plaques that cage significant amounts of water between constituents are likely to generate MR responses in the hypointensity domain (dark spots), typical for strongly correlated water. The implication of these results is that amyloids can display both dark and bright spots when compared to the normal gray background tissue on MR images. In addition, our findings predict that the bright spots are more likely to correspond to amyloids in their early stage of development. The results help explain the MR contrast patterns of amyloids and suggest a new approach for identifying unusual protein aggregation related to disease.},

abstract = {The dimetallic endohedral heterofullerene (EHF), Gd2@C79N, has been prepared and isolated in a relatively high yield. Computational (DFT), chemical reactivity, and electrochemical studies all suggest that the purified Gd2@C79N, with the heterofullerene cage, (C79N)5- has comparable stability with the better known isoelectronic (C80)6- cage species. These results describe an exceptionally stable paramagnetic molecule with low chemical reactivity and with the unpaired electron spin density mainly localized on the internal diatomic gadolinium cluster and not on the heterofullerene cage. EPR studies confirm that the spin state of Gd2@C79N is characterized by a half-integer spin quantum number of S = 15/2. The spin (S = 1/2) on the N atom of the fullerene cage and two octet spins (S = 7/2) of two encapsulated gadoliniums are coupled with each other in a ferromagnetic manner with a small zero-field splitting parameter D. Because the central line of Gd2@C79N is due to the Kramer's doublet with a half-integer spin quantum number of S = 15/2, the relatively sharp EPR line is prominent and the anisotropic nature of the line is weak. Interestingly, in contrast with most Gd3+ ion environments, the central EPR line (g=1.978) is observable even at room temperature in a toluene solution.},

The experimental DNP enhancement at (1)H Larmor frequency of 15 MHz obtained by saturating one of the lines of the (15)N doublet is only ca. 20\% lower than the limiting value predicted from the relaxation data, indicating that the experimental DNP setup is nearly optimal, the residual discrepancy arising from incomplete saturation of the other line.},

abstract = {The interactions of biological macromolecules with water are fundamental to their structure, dynamics and function. Historically, characterization of the location and residence times of hydration waters of proteins in solution has been quite difficult. Confining proteins within the nanoscale interior of a reverse micelle slows water dynamics, allowing global protein-water interactions to be detected using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Complications that normally arise from hydrogen exchange and long-range dipolar coupling are overcome by the nature of the reverse micelle medium. Characterization of the hydration of ubiquitin demonstrates that encapsulation within a reverse micelle allows detection of dozens of hydration waters. Comparison of nuclear Overhauser effects obtained in the laboratory and rotating frames indicate a considerable range of hydration water dynamics is present on the protein surface. In addition, an unprecedented clustering of different hydration-dynamics classes of sites is evident.},

Anomalous diffusion, in which mean squared displacement does not increase linearly with time, is predicted in simulations of solute diffusion in media crowded with fixed or mobile obstacles, or when solute diffusion is restricted or accelerated by a variety of geometric or active transport processes. Experimental measurements of solute diffusion in solutions and cellular aqueous compartments, however, generally show Brownian diffusion. In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

Instead, they show a distribution between hydrogen-bonded (HB) and non-hydrogen-bonded (non-HB) states, which is affected by a number of factors in the membrane composition. Similar to the exclusion of solutes from crystallizing solvents, the pure bulk gel phase excludes nitroxides, forcing acyl chains to take bent conformations. In these conformations, the nitroxide is hydrogen-bonded. Furthermore, upon gradual cooling in the supercooled gel, PC labels undergo slow lateral aggregation, resulting in a broad background signal. However, if the sample is instantly frozen, this background is replaced by the HB component. In membranes with cholesterol, the observed HB/non-HB ratio can best be described by a partition-like equilibrium between nitroxides located in defects of lipid structure within the hydrophobic core and those close to the membrane surface.},

We have analyzed lipids of exosomes secreted either upon stimulation from rat mast cells (RBL-2H3 cells), or constitutively from human dendritic cells. As compared with parent cells, exosomes displayed an enrichment in sphingomyelin, but not in cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine content was decreased, but an enrichment was noted in disatd. mol. species as in phosphatidylethanolamines. Lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid was not enriched in exosomes as compared with cells. Fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated an increase in exosome-membrane rigidity from pH 5 to 7, suggesting their membrane reorganization between the acidic multivesicular body compartment and the neutral outer cell medium. NMR anal. established a bilayer organization of exosome membrane, and ESR studies using 16-doxyl stearic acid demonstrated a higher flip-flop of lipids between the two leaflets as compared with plasma membrane. In addn., the exosome membrane exhibited no asym. distribution of phosphatidylethanolamines. Therefore exosome membrane displays a similar content of the major phospholipids and cholesterol, and is organized as a lipid bilayer with a random distribution of phosphatidylethanolamines.

abstract = {We report the effect of macromolecular crowding on encapsulation efficiency of fluorescently labeled poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran polymers within individual giant lipid vesicles (GVs). Low concentrations of the fluorescently labeled polymers (82 nM to 186 pM) were mixed with varying concentrations of nonfluorescent polymers that served as crowding agents during vesicle formation by gentle hydration. Encapsulation efficiency of the fluorescently labeled polymers in individual GVs (EEind) was determined via confocal fluorescence microscopy. EEind for high molecular weight polymers (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran 500 and 2000 kDa) increased substantially in the presence of several weight percent unlabeled PEG or dextran. For example, when 0.24 microM FITC dextran 500 kDa was encapsulated, addition of 3\% PEG 8 kDa improved the mean concentration in the GVs from 0.14 microM (+/-50\%) to 0.24 microM (+/-12\%). Light scattering data indicate reduced hydrodynamic radii for polymers as a function of increasing polymer concentration, suggesting that the improvements in EEind result from polymer condensation due to macromolecular crowding. Polymeric cosolutes did not significantly impact EEind for lower molecular weight polymers (e.g., Alexa Fluor 488-PEG 20 kDa), which already encapsulated efficiently (EEind to approximately 1). However, for both the higher and lower molecular weight labeled polymers, cosolutes led to improved uniformity in EEind for vesicles within a batch. Methods for improving the value and homogeneity of EEind for polymeric solutes in lipid vesicles are important in a variety of applications, including the use of vesicles as microreactors and as vehicles for drug delivery.},

The parent FDMPO spin trap exhibits a single F-19-NMR resonance at -66.0 ppm. The signal to noise ratio improved 10.4-fold compared to P-31-NMR sensitivity of the phosphorus-containing spin trap, DEPMPO. The spin adducts of FDMPO with (OH)-O-., (CH3)-C-., and (CH2OH)-C-. were characterized. Competitive spin trapping of FDMPO with DMPO showed that both have similar rates of addition of (OH)-O-. and C-centered radicals. The corresponding paramagnetic spin adducts of FDMPO were extremely stable to degradation. In the presence of ascorbate, reaction products from C-centered radicals resulted in the appearance of two additional F-19-NMR signals at -78.6 and -80 ppm for FDMPO/(CH3)-C-. and at -74.6 and -76.75 ppm for FDMPO/(CH2OH)-C-.. In each case, these peaks were assigned to the two stereoisomers of their respective, reduced hydroxylamines. The identification of the hydroxylamines for FDMPO/(CH3)-C-. was confirmed by EPR and F-19-NMR spectra of independently synthesized samples. In summary, spin adducts of FDMPO were highly stable for ESR. For NMR spin trapping, FDMPO showed improved signal to noise and similar spin trapping efficiency compared to DEPMPO.

abstract = {The structure of polyacrylamide gels was studied using proton spin-lattice relaxation and PFG diffusion methods. Polyacrylamide gels, with total polymer concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 0.35 g/ml and crosslinker concentrations from 0 to 10\% by weight, were studied. The data showed no effect of the crosslinker concentration on the diffusion of water molecules. The Ogston-Morris and Mackie-Meares models fit the general trends observed for water diffusion in gels. The diffusion coefficients from the volume averaging method also fit the data, and this theory was able to account for the effects of water-gel interactions that are not accounted for in the other two theories. The averaging theory also did not require the physically unrealistic assumption, required in the other two theories, that the acrylamide fibers are of similar size to water molecules. Contrary to the diffusion data,T1relaxation measurements showed a significant effect of crosslinker concentration on the relaxation of water in gels. The model developed using the Bloch equations and the volume averaging method described the effects of water adsorption on the gel medium on both the diffusion coefficients and the relaxation measurements. In the proposed model the gel medium was assumed to consist of three phases (i.e., bulk water, uncrosslinked acrylamide fibers, and a bisacrylamide crosslinker phase). The effects of the crosslinker concentration were accounted for by introducing the proton partition coefficient,Keq, between the bulk water and crosslinker phase. The derived relaxation equations were successful in fitting the experimental data. The partition coefficient,Keq, decreased significantly as the crosslinker concentration increased from 5 to 10\% by weight. This trend is consistent with the idea that bisacrylamide tends to form hydrophobic regions with increasing crosslinker concentration.},

abstract = {We describe a new triply tuned (e(-), H-1, and C-13) resonance structure operating at an electron Larmor frequency of 139.5 GHz for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and electron nuclear double-resonance (ENDOR) experiments. In contrast to conventional double-resonance structures, the body of the microwave cavity simultaneously acts as a NMR coil, allowing for increased efficiency of radiofrequency irradiation while maintaining a high quality factor for microwave irradiation. The resonator design is ideal for low-gamma-nuclei ENDOR, where sensitivity is limited by the fact that electron spin relaxation times are on the order of the RF pulse lengths. The performance is demonstrated with H-2 ENDOR on a standard perdeuterated bis-diphenylene-phenyl-allyl stable radical. In DNP experiments, we show that the use of this resonator, combined with a low microwave power setup (17 mW), leads to significantly higher H-1 signal enhancement (epsilon similar to 400 +/- 50) than previously achieved at 5-T fields. The results emphasize the importance of optimizing the microwave B-1 field by improving either the quality factor of the microwave resonator or the microwave power level. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of nanogap capacitors as potential label free biosensors are presented. The nanogap device is capable of detecting the existence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides (20-mer) in 100 nM aqueous solutions using a 20 nm gap of 1.2 pl in volume. While the dielectric properties of DNA solution have been widely investigated, early approaches are limited at low frequency by the parasitic noise due to the electrical double layer (EDL) impedance. Nanogap electrodes have the potential to serve as biomolecular junctions because their size (5-100 nm) minimizes electrode polarization effects regardless of frequency. In this paper, we modeled the effects of the EDL interaction between two parallel nanogap electrodes by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for equilibrium state. When the gap size is smaller than the EDL thickness, the dependence of the nanogap capacitance on the ionic strength is insignificant. This is critical in using the capacitance change as an indicator of the existence of target molecules. The predicted capacitance of nanogaps filled with various ionic strength electrolytes was in quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. The various concentrations of the target molecules in nanogap sensor were characterized. A capacitance change of a 20 nm x (10)1.5 microm x 4mm gap from 3.5 to 4.1 nF at 200 Hz was recorded between deionized water (DI) and 100 nM ssDNA solution (about 70,000 molecules inside the gap for equilibrium state).},

abstract = {1H dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has been measured in supercritical ethylene in the pressure range 60-300 bar in an external field of 1.4 T. A single-cell sapphire tube was used as a high-pressure cell, and powdered 1,3-bisdiphenylene-2-phenyl allyl (BDPA) free radicals were added and distributed at the wall of the cell. At all pressures the dominant DNP mechanism was a positive Overhauser enhancement, caused by proton-electron contact interactions at the fluid/solid radical interface. The observed enhancements varied from 12 at 60 bar to 17 at 300 bar. Besides the Overhauser enhancement, small solid state and thermal mixing enhancements also were observed, indicating that part of the ethylene was adsorbed at the radical surface for a prolonged time. The impacts of the experimental conditions on the Overhauser enhancement factors are discussed, and enhancements of at least 40-60 are estimated when the EPR saturation factor and the leakage factor become maximal. These data indicate that DNP-enhanced NMR has the potential of extending the impact of NMR in research areas involving supercritical fluids.},

We present systematic studies of the (13)C DNP enhancement of (13)C-labeled small molecules in aqueous solution under ambient conditions, where we observe both dipolar and scalar-mediated enhancement. We show the role of the three-spin effects from enhanced protons on (13)C DNP through DNP experiments with and without broadband (1)H decoupling and by comparing DNP results with H(2)O and D(2)O. We conclude that the efficiency of (13)C Overhauser DNP in small molecules strongly depends on the distance of closest approach between the electron and (13)C nucleus, the presence of a scalar contribution to the coupling factor, and the magnitude of the three-spin effect due to adjacent polarized protons. The enhancement appears to depend less on the translational dynamics of the (13)C-labeled small molecules and radicals.},

abstract = {Site-directed labeling was used to obtain local information on the binding interface in a receptor-ligand complex, As a model we have chosen the specific association of the extracellular part of tissue factor (sTF) and factor VIIa (FVIIa), the primary initiator of the blood coagulation cascade. Different spectroscopic labels were covalently attached to an engineered cysteine in position 140 in sTF, a position normally occupied by a Phe residue previously characterized as an important contributor to the sTF:FVIIa interaction. Two spin labels, IPSL [N-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl etamide] and MTSSL [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate], and two fluorescent labels, IAEDANS [5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino) ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid] and BADAN [6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene], were used. Spectral data from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a substantial change in the local environment of all labels when the sTF:FVIIa complex was formed. However, the interaction was probed differently by each label and these differences in spectral appearance could be attributed to differences in label properties such as size, polarity, and/or flexibility. Accordingly, molecular modeling data suggest that the most favorable orientations are unique for each label. Furthermore, line-shape simulations of EPR spectra and calculations based on fluorescence depolarization measurements provided additional details of the local environment of the labels, thereby confirming a tight protein-protein interaction between FVIIa and sTF when the complex is formed. The tightness of this local interaction is similar to that seen in the interior of globular proteins.},

A stable nitroxide radical, 1-oxyl-4-bromo-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline (R5a), was attached postsynthetically to phosphorothioates that were chemically introduced, one at a time, at five sites of a DNA duplex. The two phosphorothioate diastereomers (R(p) or S(p)) were separated, and nitroxide rotational motions were monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra vary according to diastereomer identity and location of the labeling site, with R(p)-R5a spectra effectively reporting on local DNA structural features and S(p)-R5a spectra sensing variations in local DNA motions. This establishes R(p)- and S(p)-R5a as unique probes for investigating nucleic acids in a site- and stereospecific manner, which may aid studies of stereospecific DNA/protein interactions. In addition, weighted averages of individual R(p) and S(p) spectra match those of R5a attached to mixed diastereomers. This suggests that R5a linked to mixed diastereomers reports on the composite behaviors of R(p)- and S(p)-R5a and is useful in initial probing of the DNA local environment. This work advances understanding of R5a/DNA coupling, and is a key step forward in developing a nucleotide-independent spectroscopic probe for studying nucleic acids.},

abstract = {Localized surface plasmons of metallic particles of subwavelength sizes strongly modify the spectral properties of nearby fluorophores. The enhanced radiative decay rate leads to high fluorescence efficiencies and decreased fluorescence lifetimes. In this report we show that metal-enhanced fluorescence generated by the presence of the silver islands on the glass substrate displays high depolarization. Intensities, lifetimes, and emission anisotropies of several fluorophore protein conjugates have been studied in the absence and presence of metallic nanostructures. Despite highly decreased lifetimes of about 10-fold and immobilization of conjugates on the solid substrate, the observed emission anisotropies for all fluorophores on the metal-enhanced substrate decreased 300-500\% compared to that in solution. This observation implies a new generation of fluorescence polarization immunoassays with broad applications because of no restrictions to the lifetime of the probe and the size of labeled biomolecules. The changes in polarization are due to binding that occur on the bioactive surface localized near the metal particles.},

abstract = {An ultra-stable variable temperature accessory for EPR experiments with biological samples has been designed and tested. The accessory is comprised from a digitally controlled circulator bath that pumps fluid through high-efficiency aluminum radiators attached to an EPR resonator of a commercial X-band EPR spectrometer. Temperature stability of this new accessory after a 15 min re-equilibration is at least +/- 0.007 K. For a standard 1-cm-long capillary sample arranged inside an EPR tube filled with silicon oil, the temperature variations do not exceed +/- 0.033 K over the sample temperature range from 283 to 333 K. This new accessory has been tested by carrying out a comparative spin-labeling EPR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study of the gel-to-liquid phase transition in multilamellar vesicles (MLV) composed of a synthetic phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). We demonstrate that the gel-to-liquid phase transition temperatures of MLV DMPC measured by EPR and DSC agree within +/- 0.02 K experimental error even though the sample for EPR study was labeled with 1 mol\% of 5PC (1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(5-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine). Cooperative unit number measured by EPR, N = 676 +/- 36, was almost 50\% higher than that obtained from DSC (N = 458 +/- 18). These high values of N indicate that (i) the lipid domains should include at least several spin-labeled lipid molecules and (ii) the spin-probe 5PC molecules are not excluded into domains that are different from the bulk lipid phase as was speculated earlier. Overall, our data provide DSC and EPR evidence that in studies of the gel-to-liquid phase transition, the effect of bilayer perturbation by spin-labeled lipids is negligible and therefore thermodynamic parameters of the phase transition can be accurately measured by spin-labeling EPR. This might serve as an indication when spin-labeled molecules with structures similar to those of lipids are introduced at low concentrations, they are easily accommodated by fluid phospholipid bilayers without significant losses of the lipid cooperativity.

abstract = {Proteorhodopsins (PRs), photoactive retinylidene membrane proteins ubiquitous in marine eubacteria, exhibit light-driven proton transport activity similar to that of the well studied bacteriorhodopsin from halophilic archaea. However, unlike bacteriorhodopsin, PRs have a single highly conserved histidine located near the photoactive site of the protein. Time-resolved Fourier transform IR difference spectroscopy combined with visible absorption spectroscopy, isotope labeling, and electrical measurements of light-induced charge movements reveal participation of His-75 in the proton translocation mechanism of PR. Substitution of His-75 with Ala or Glu perturbed the structure of the photoactive site and resulted in significantly shifted visible absorption spectra. In contrast, His-75 substitution with a positively charged Arg did not shift the visible absorption spectrum of PR. The mutation to Arg also blocks the light-induced proton transfer from the Schiff base to its counterion Asp-97 during the photocycle and the acid-induced protonation of Asp-97 in the dark state of the protein. Isotope labeling of histidine revealed that His-75 undergoes deprotonation during the photocycle in the proton-pumping (high pH) form of PR, a reaction further supported by results from H75E. Finally, all His-75 mutations greatly affect charge movements within the PR and shift its pH dependence to acidic values. A model of the proteorhodopsin proton transport process is proposed as follows: (i) in the dark state His-75 is positively charged (protonated) over a wide pH range and interacts directly with the Schiff base counterion Asp-97; and (ii) photoisomerization-induced transfer of the Schiff base proton to the Asp-97 counterion disrupts its interaction with His-75 and triggers a histidine deprotonation.},

The DNP factor is considered as a function of the magnetic field and as a function of the direction of the applied RF field, The equations make it possible to calculate the theoretical DNP spectra of nitroxide which is essential for the interpretation of the DNP spectra of nitroxides in a very low magnetic field, The EPR spectra obtained by field-cycling dynamic nuclear polarization with an RF field for the EPR irradiation at 64, 72, and 74 MHz for the TXO(N-14) and 62 and 66 MHz for the PCD(N-15) nitroxides are presented, The RF field for EPR saturation was applied perpendicular to the static magnetic field in order to induce pi transitions, except for the 64 and 74 MHz spectra of the TXO(N-14) nitroxide, in which the RF field was applied parallel to the static magnetic field in order to induce sigma transitions.

abstract = {Identifying equilibrium conformational exchange and characterizing conformational substates is essential for elucidating mechanisms of function in proteins. Site-directed spin labeling has previously been employed to detect conformational changes triggered by some event, but verifying conformational exchange at equilibrium is more challenging. Conformational exchange (microsecond-millisecond) is slow on the EPR time scale, and this proves to be an advantage in directly revealing the presence of multiple substates as distinguishable components in the EPR spectrum, allowing the direct determination of equilibrium constants and free energy differences. However, rotameric exchange of the spin label side chain can also give rise to multiple components in the EPR spectrum. Using spin-labeled mutants of T4 lysozyme, it is shown that high-pressure EPR can be used to: (i) demonstrate equilibrium between spectrally resolved states, (ii) aid in distinguishing conformational from rotameric exchange as the origin of the resolved states, and (iii) determine the relative partial molar volume ($\Delta$V°) and isothermal compressibility ($\Delta$$\beta$(T)) of conformational substates in two-component equilibria from the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant. These volumetric properties provide insight into the structure of the substates. Finally, the pressure dependence of internal side-chain motion is interpreted in terms of volume fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale, the magnitude of which may reflect local backbone flexibility.},

abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules in confining or crowded environments are different from those in simple bulk liquids. In this paper, both the conformational and diffusional dynamics of globular polymers are studied in solutions containing fixed spherical obstacles. These properties are studied as a function of obstacle volume fraction and size, as well as polymer chain length. The results are obtained using a hybrid scheme that combines multiparticle collision dynamics of the solvent with molecular dynamics that includes the interactions among the polymer monomers and between the polymer beads and obstacles and solvent molecules. The dynamics accounts for hydrodynamic interactions among the polymer beads and intermolecular forces with the solvent molecules. We consider polymers in poor solvents where the polymer chain adopts a compact globular structure in solution. Our results show that the collapse of the polymer chain to a compact globular state is strongly influenced by the obstacle array. A nonmonotonic variation in the radius of gyration with time is observed and the collapse time scale is much longer than that in simple solutions without obstacles. Hydrodynamic interactions are important at low obstacle volume fractions but are screened at high volume fractions. The diffusion of the globular polymer chain among the obstacles is subdiffusive in character on intermediate time scales where the dynamics explores the local structure of the heterogeneous environment. For large polymer chains in systems with high obstacle volume fractions, the chain adopts bloblike conformations that arise from trapping of portions of the chain in voids among the obstacles.},

Correlation functions corresponding to the dipolar and scalar spin-spin couplings are computed from the simulations. The dynamic nuclear polarization coupling factors deduced from these correlation functions are in good agreement with experiment over a broad range of magnetic field strengths.

It has enabled studies that resolve sophisticated details of molecular dynamics in complex fluids. (b) Methods that produce multiple quantum coherences by pulsed ESR now enable accurate measurements of large distances (>12A). (c) One of the most important advances has been the extension of ESR to high magnetic fields and high frequencies. This has benefited from the utilization of quasi-optical methods, especially above 150 GHz. The greatly improved orientational resolution and the faster "snapshot" of motions that are provided by ESR at high frequencies enhance studies of molecular dynamics. The use of both high and lower frequencies enables one to unravel faster and slower modes from the complex dynamics of fluids and macromolecules. (d) The development of FT-ESR imaging required substantial pulsed field gradients lasting only 50-100 ns. ESR imaging is effective in studying diffusion in fluids.

abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a method that permits NMR signal intensities of solids and liquids to be enhanced significantly, and is therefore potentially an important tool in structural and mechanistic studies of biologically relevant molecules. During a DNP experiment, the large polarization of an exogeneous or endogeneous unpaired electron is transferred to the nuclei of interest (I) by microwave (microw) irradiation of the sample. The maximum theoretical enhancement achievable is given by the gyromagnetic ratios (gamma(e)gamma(l)), being approximately 660 for protons. In the early 1950s, the DNP phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally, and intensively investigated in the following four decades, primarily at low magnetic fields. This review focuses on recent developments in the field of DNP with a special emphasis on work done at high magnetic fields (> or =5 T), the regime where contemporary NMR experiments are performed. After a brief historical survey, we present a review of the classical continuous wave (cw) DNP mechanisms-the Overhauser effect, the solid effect, the cross effect, and thermal mixing. A special section is devoted to the theory of coherent polarization transfer mechanisms, since they are potentially more efficient at high fields than classical polarization schemes. The implementation of DNP at high magnetic fields has required the development and improvement of new and existing instrumentation. Therefore, we also review some recent developments in microw and probe technology, followed by an overview of DNP applications in biological solids and liquids. Finally, we outline some possible areas for future developments.},

abstract = {This report describes a computer-aided CW- and pulsed-ESR (EPR) investigation on the structural modification of dimyristoylphosphatidylcoline (DMPC) vesicles, which occur upon interaction with starburst dendrimers (SBDs). Probes used for this study included doxyl-functionalized stearic acids, with the doxyl group attached at different positions of the stearic chain (5DXSA, 12DXSA, and 16DXSA). Mainly mobility and polarity parameters were evaluated from the anal. of the CW-EPR spectra, whereas the anal. of the decay and modulation of the electron spin-echo (ESE) signal provided information on the structural environment of the paramagnetic center. Due to the interaction with the SBD surface, the vesicle structure became more rigid and ordered. The enhanced rigidity of the structure also caused the tilting of the chains of about 50 Deg with respect to the surface line. The permeability of water at the chain beginning level increased, thus increasing the rotational mobility of the probe. The perturbing effects lessened toward the end of the chains. A fraction of 16DXSA (15\%) was in the bent conformation, with the chain inserted into the lipid layer and the two polar heads at the external surface. The interaction with protonated dendrimers caused the swelling of the vesicle structure. This study indicated that the bilayer structure is modified but only partially perturbed by the addn. of the dendrimers, and the integrity of the vesicle, as a model cell membrane, is preserved after the interaction with the dendrimers. This is encouraging for the use of the SBDs as drug and gene carriers. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization has enabled hyperpolarization of nuclei such as C-13 and N-15 in endogenous substances. The resulting high nuclear polarization makes it possible to perform subsecond C-13 MRI. By using the dynamic nuclear polarization hyperpolarization technique, 10\% polarization was obtained in an aqueous solution of 100 mM C-13-labeled urea, ready for injection. The in vivo T, relaxation time of C-13 in the urea solution was determined to 20 +/- 2 s. Due to the long relaxation time, it is possible to use the hyperpolarized substance for medical imaging. A series of high-resolution (approximate to1-mm) magnetic resonance images were acquired, each with a scan time of 240 ms, 0-5 s after an i.v. injection of the hyperpolarized aqueous [C-13]urea solution in a rat. The results show that it is possible to perform C-13 angiography with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximate to275 in approximate to0.25 s. Perfusion studies with endogenous substances may allow higher spatial and/or temporal resolution than is possible with current proton imaging techniques.},

abstract = {At low temperatures, proteins exist in a glassy state, a state that has no conformational flexibility and shows no biological functions. In a hydrated protein, at temperatures greater-- similar 220 K, this flexibility is restored, and the protein is able to sample more conformational substates, thus becoming biologically functional. This "dynamical" transition of protein is believed to be triggered by its strong coupling with the hydration water, which also shows a similar dynamic transition. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this sudden switch in dynamic behavior of the hydration water on lysozyme occurs precisely at 220 K and can be described as a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover. At the fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover, the structure of hydration water makes a transition from predominantly high-density (more fluid state) to low-density (less fluid state) forms derived from the existence of the second critical point at an elevated pressure.},

abstract = {Hydration site lifetimes of slowly diffusing water molecules at the protein/DNA interface of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain DNA complex were determined using novel three-dimensional NMR techniques. The lifetimes were calculated using the ratios of ROE and NOE cross-relaxation rates between the water and the protein backbone and side chain amides. This calculation of the lifetimes is based on a model of the spectral density function of the water-protein interaction consisting of three timescales of motion: fast vibrational/rotational motion, diffusion into/out of the hydration site, and overall macromolecular tumbling. The lifetimes measured ranged from approximately 400 ps to more than 5 ns, and nearly all the slowly diffusing water molecules detected lie at the protein/DNA interface. A quantitative analysis of relayed water cross-relaxation indicated that even at very short mixing times. 5 ms for ROESY and 12 ms for NOESY, relay of magnetization can make a small but detectable contribution to the measured rates. The temperature dependences of the NOE rates were measured to help discriminate direct dipolar cross-relaxation from chemical exchange. Comparison with several X-ray structures of homeodomain/DNA complexes reveals a strong correspondence between water molecules in conserved locations and the slowly diffusing water molecules detected by NMR. A homology model based on the X-ray structures was created to visualize the conserved water molecules detected at the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain DNA interface. Two chains of water molecules are seen at the right and left sides of the major groove, adjacent to the third helix of the homeodomain. Two water-mediated hydrogen bond bridges spanning the protein/DNA interface are present in the model, one between the backbone of Phe8 and a DNA phosphate, and one between the side chain of Asn51 and a DNA phosphate. The hydrogen bond bridge between Asn51 and the DNA might be especially important since the DNA contact made by the invariant Asn51 residue, seen in all known homeodomain/DNA structures, is critical for binding affinity and specificity.},

We find a dramatic decrease in the THz absorption, if the number of water molecules per solute is less than 18-20. This change is taken as a signature for the breakdown of peptide-water network motions, which supports the hypothesis that a minimum number of hydration waters is required to activate these motions. This is well below a monolayer coverage of the model peptides. It is interesting to note that the required hydration level corresponds to the number of water molecules which are required for biological functionality.},

Obtaining experimental access to their structures, conformational fluctuations, orientations, locations, and hydration in membrane environments, as well as the lipid membrane properties, is critical to understanding their functions. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of frozen solids can dramatically boost the sensitivity of current solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance tools to enhance access to membrane protein structures in native membrane environments. Overhauser DNP in the solution state can map out the local and site-specific hydration dynamics landscape of membrane proteins and lipid membranes, critically complementing the structural and dynamics information obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we provide an overview of how DNP methods in solids and solutions can significantly increase our understanding of membrane protein structures, dynamics, functions, and hydration in complex biological membrane environments.

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that uses Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to provide contrast during the continuous delivery of hyperpolarized water in rats. Materials and Methods: Protocols approved by the local institutional animal care and use committees were followed. Twelve male Wistar rats were anesthetized and prepared by placing injection tubing in the subcutaneous layer (n = 3), peritoneum (n = 3), aorta (n = 3), or carotid artery (n = 3). Water was hyperpolarized by means of Overhauser DNP in the 0.35-T fringe field of a 1.5-T MR imaging magnet by using a custom-built system to continuously deliver radical-free hyperpolarized water to the subject. Fast gradient-echo and spoiled gradient-recalled-echo MR imaging sequences were used. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the images was calculated and compared. Results: Images showed greatly altered SNR and enhanced flow contrast at all injection locations. For subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injections, the water perfusion trajectory was observed for approximately 5 seconds after injection. Flow through a 4.2-cm length of artery was seen during intra-aortic injection. The right hemisphere of the brain was seen during injection into the right carotid artery. Images with hyperpolarized water had greatly altered SNR compared with images without injection or with the injection of nonhyperpolarized water, with a range of 13\%-27\% for the carotid and 444\%-2900\% for the other regions. Conclusion: Perfusion contrast for MR imaging can be obtained by continuously infusing hyperpolarized water, providing localized angiography or brain perfusion information in vivo for rat models. © RSNA, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111804/-/DC1.},

@article{Grucker1995,
abstract = {The most widely used free radicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments or related Overhauser imaging are nitroxides. The DNP parameters in biological fluids were measured in order to provide guidelines for the design of new nitroxides, adapted to the biological applications of DNP. Eighteen nitroxides were studied at a concentration of 1 mM. Extrapolation at complete electron paramagnetic resonance saturation and proton longitudinal-relaxation-time measurements enable calculation of the coupling factor between nitroxide free electrons and water protons. In deoxygenated phosphate-buffered solutions, the NMR signal enhancement by DNP ranged from -36.3 to -6.7, and the coupling factor ranged from 0.31 to 0.03, Nitroxides with a long side chain yield poor enhancement, although their relaxivity is far greater than that of nitroxides with small chains. In a I mM albumin solution, the loss in enhancement factor is mainly caused by the fact that proton relaxation occurs via interactions, not only with the dissolved free radicals but also with the albumin macromolecules. In serum, the enhancement factor is lower than that in an albumin solution, because of the higher protein concentration in serum. In red-blood-cell suspensions, the enhancement factor was further decreased, Two effects contribute to this decrease: first, the increased viscosity due to the presence of red blood cells, and second, the susceptibility effects of the paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin. The high sensitivity to oxygen of DNP in phosphate-buffered solution is also greatly reduced when nitroxides are dissolved in blood, In red-blood-cell solutions there is competition between the removal of O-2, which favors proton relaxation by the free radical, and the increase of deoxyhemoglobin, which provides the water protons with another sink of relaxation, On the basis of this study, the properties of nitroxides for use in biological application must fulfill four criteria; i.e., they must have an EPR linewidth narrower than 100 mG, a relaxivity greater than 2.5 (mM s)(-1), a good stability with a half-life time in biological fluids exceeding 1 hour, and low toxicity, (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {In site-directed spin labeling, the relative solvent accessibility of spin-labeled side chains is taken to be proportional to the Heisenberg exchange rate (W(ex)) of the nitroxide with a paramagnetic reagent in solution. In turn, relative values of W(ex) are determined by continuous wave power saturation methods and expressed as a proportional and dimensionless parameter Pi. In the experiments presented here, NiEDDA is characterized as a paramagnetic reagent for solvent accessibility studies, and it is shown that absolute values of W(ex) can be determined from Pi, and that the proportionality constant relating them is independent of the paramagnetic reagent and mobility of the nitroxide. Based on absolute exchange rates, an accessibility factor is defined (0 < rho < 1) that serves as a quantitative measure of side-chain solvent accessibility. The accessibility factors for a nitroxide side chain at 14 different sites in T4 lysozyme are shown to correlate with a structure-based accessibility parameter derived from the crystal structure of the protein. These results provide a useful means for relating crystallographic and site-directed spin labeling data, and hence comparing crystal and solution structures.},

A 1:1 stoichiometry for the nitrones with randomly methylated b-cyclodextrin and 2,6-di-O-methyl-b-cyclodextrin and 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometries for the corresponding cyclodextrin-nitroxide complexes were obsd. After the superoxide radical spin trapping reaction, EPR titrns. afforded the assocn. consts. of the corresponding cyclodextrin-nitroxide complexes. Two-dimensional EPR simulations indicated a bimodal inclusion of the nitroxide free radical spin adducts into the cyclodextrins. For all the nitrone-cyclodextrin and nitroxide-cyclodextrin complexes, the assocn. consts. were always higher for the nitroxide complexes than for the nitrone complexes. A cooperative system concerning the complexation of the nitroxide spin adduct with a cyclodextrin was evidenced by EPR titrns. The efficiency of the cyclodextrin inclusion technique to trap superoxide and to resist bio-redn. by sodium L-ascorbate was also investigated. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {We have recently proposed a protocol for retrieving multidimensional magnetic resonance spectra and images within a single scan, based on a spatial encoding of the spin interactions. The spatial selectivity of this encoding process also opens up new possibilities for compensating magnetic field inhomogeneities; not by demanding extreme uniformities from the B(0) fields, but by compensating for their effects at an excitation and/or refocusing level. This potential is hereby discussed and demonstrated in connection with the single-scan acquisition of high-definition multidimensional images. It is shown that in combination with time-dependent gradient and radiofrequency manipulations, the new compensation approach can be used to counteract substantial field inhomogenities at either global or local levels over relatively long periods of time. The new compensation scheme could find uses in areas where heterogeneities in magnetic fields present serious obstacles, including rapid studies in regions near tissue/air interfaces. The principles of the B(0) compensation method are reviewed for one- and higher-dimensional cases, and experimentally demonstrated on a series of 1D and 2D single-scan MRI experiments on simple phantoms.},

There is evidence for a complexation equil. between 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy(1) and b-cyclodextrin, but not with a-cyclodextrin. 4-Hydroxy- and 4-oxo-substituted tetramethylpiperidinyloxy radicals are not complexed by a- or b-cyclodextrins. On the other hand, oxazolidinyloxy derivs. are complexed either by a- and b-cyclodextrins or by b-cyclodextrin only, depending on the size of the radicals. Hyperfine splittings are consistent with a nonpolar environment of the complexed nitroxide group. These results are interpreted as evidence for inclusion of the nitroxide radical in the cyclodextrin cavity.

abstract = {We present a systematic study of the frequency noise experienced by a charged atomic force microscope cantilever due to thermal dielectric fluctuations in a thin-film sample of poly(vinyl acetate). Here, the tip of the commercial atomic force microscope cantilever oscillates in the conventional direction, normal to the surface of the film, complementing our previous studies of dielectric fluctuations carried out using an ultrasensitive custom-fabricated cantilever oscillating parallel to the film surface. We show that frequency noise induced by mechanical vibrations can be distinguished from frequency noise resulting from thermal dielectric fluctuations by the dependence on applied voltage and tip-sample separation, allowing molecular information to be unambiguously extracted. A linear response theory for cantilever frequency noise over a molecular material correctly reproduces the observed dependences on frequency, voltage, and tip-sample separation. The technique is shown to measure primarily fluctuations in the electric field gradient over the surface, which in these measurements are generated by orientational relaxation of polar polymer segments.},

abstract = {The size of the anisotropic domains in a lyotropic liquid crystal is estimated using a new protocol for diffusion NMR. Echo attenuation decays are recorded for different durations of the displacement-encoding gradient pulses, while keeping the effective diffusion time and the range of the wave vectors constant. Deviations between the sets of data appear if there are non-Gaussian diffusion processes occurring on the time-scale defined by the gradient pulse duration and the length-scale defined by the wave vector. The homogeneous length-scale is defined as the minimum length-scale for which the diffusion appears to be Gaussian. Simulations are performed to show that spatial variation of the director orientation in an otherwise homogeneous system is sufficient to induce non-Gaussian diffusion. The method is demonstrated by numerical solutions of the Bloch-Torrey equation and experiments on a range of lamellar liquid crystals with different domain sizes.},

For pulsed EPR we obtain an absolute sensitivity of 3x10(9) spins/Gauss at 20 K. The performance of the spectrometer is demonstrated with pulsed ENDOR spectra of a standard bis-diphenylene-phenyl-allyl (BDPA) doped into polystyrene and of the tyrosyl radical from E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).

Nitroxide spin probes enable measurement of tissue redox state based on their redn. to diamagnetic hydroxylamines. PEDRI instrumentation at 0.02 T was applied to assess the ability to image the in vivo distribution, clearance, and metab. of nitroxide radicals in living mice. Using phantoms of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-carboxylpyrrolidine-N-oxyl (PCA) in normal saline the dependence of the enhancement on RF power and spin probe concn. was detd. Enhancements of up to -23 were obtained in phantoms with 2 mM levels. Maximum enhancement of -7 was obsd. in vivo. Coronal images of nitroxide-infused mice enabled visualization of the kinetics of spin probe uptake and clearance in different organs including the great vessels, heart, lungs, kidneys, and bladder with an in-plane spatial resoln. of 0.6 mm. PEDRI of living mice was also performed using 3-carbamoyl-proxyl and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxopiperidine-N-oxyl to compare the different rate of clearance and metab. among different nitroxide probes. PCA, due to its intravascular compartmentalization, provided the sharpest contrast for the vascular system and highest enhancement values in the PEDRI images among the three nitroxides.

abstract = {A two-dimensional Fourier Transform ESR (2D FT ESR) spectrometer operating at 9.25 and 17.35 GHz is described. The Ku-band bridge uses an efficient heterodyne technique wherein 9.25 GHz is the intermediate frequency. At Ku-band the sensitivity is increased by almost an order of magnitude. One may routinely collect a full 2D ELDOR spectrum in less than 20 min for a sample containing 0.5-5 nmol of nitroxide spin-probe in the slow-motional regime. Broad spectral coverage at Ku-band is obtained by use of a bridged loop-gap resonator (BLGR) and of a dielectric ring resonator (DR). It is shown that an even more uniform spectral excitation is obtained by using shorter microwave pulses of about 3 ns duration. The dead-time at Ku-band is just 30-40 ns, yielding an improved SNR in 2D ELDOR spectra of nitroxide spin-probes with T2 as short as 20-30 ns. A comparison of 2D ELDOR spectra obtained at 9.25 and 17. 35 GHz for spin-labeled phospholipid probes (16PC) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) membrane vesicles showed that both spectra could be satisfactorily simulated using the same set of model parameters even though they are markedly different in appearance. The improved sensitivity and shorter dead-time at Ku-band made it possible to obtain orientation-dependent 2D ELDOR spectra of the Cholestane (CSL) spin-probe in macroscopically aligned lipid bilayers of egg yolk PC using samples containing only 1 mg of lipid and just 5 nmol of spin-probe.},

Using high precision simulations, and careful application of standard analytical corrections, we show that the new TIP4P-Ew potential has a density maximum at approximately 1 degrees C, and reproduces experimental bulk-densities and the enthalpy of vaporization, DeltaH(vap), from -37.5 to 127 degrees C at 1 atm with an absolute average error of less than 1\%. Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degrees C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.},

The asphaltene was extracted from MC-800 liquid asphalt. Intermolecular spin-spin interactions occur between nuclear spins of hydrogen in the solvent medium and the free electron spins in the asphaltene micelles. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the asphaltene was obtained and the saturation experiments were applied to the samples prepared in vacuum. For all media, the dipole-dipole interaction is predominant due to the negative signal enhancements. In all temperatures, the ultimate enhancement is the smallest for the p-xylene solvent medium which has the lowest electrical dipole moment. The normalized low frequency relaxation components were calculated for 25 degrees C, and the behavior of the nuclear-electron coupling parameter according to this component is in agreement with the other works in the literature.},

abstract = {Thirty consecutive single cysteine substitution mutants in the amino acids Q225-I256 of bovine rhodopsin have been prepared and modified with a sulfhydryl specific nitroxide reagent. This sequence includes the E-F interhelical loop, a transducin interaction site. The accessibilities of the attached nitroxides to collisions with hydrophilic and hydrophobic paramagnetic probes in solution were determined, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra analyzed in terms of side chain mobility, both in the dark and after photoactivation. Accessibility cata shows that the rhodopsin polypeptide chain crosses an aqueous/ hydrophobic boundary in the range V227-K231 and again in the range V250-V254. In the hydrophobic segments, both the accessibility and mobility data are consistent with helical structures. In the regions of the sequence located within the aqueous phase, periodic variation in both accessibility and mobility of the spin-labeled side chains indicates that the E-F interhelical loop is largely alpha-helical, being formed by regular extensions of the E and F helices by about 1.5 and 3 turns, respectively. Judging from nitroxide mobilities, the putative extension of helix E in the aqueous phase is more dynamic than that of helix F. Changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance characteristics of the spin-labeled rhodopsin upon photoactivation indicate that chromophore isomerization results in patterns of structural changes that can be interpreted in terms of movements of helices that extend into the aqueous loop regions.},

abstract = {Proton nuclear magnetic resonance was used to study individual molecules of hydration water bound to the protein basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and to the nonapeptide oxytocin in aqueous solution. The experimental observations are nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between protons of individual amino acid residues of the protein and those of hydration water. These NOEs were recorded by two-dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) in the laboratory frame, and by the corresponding experiments in the rotating frame (ROESY). The studies show that there are two qualitatively different types of hydration sites. Four water molecules in the interior of the BPTI molecule are in identical locations in the crystal structure and in solution. Their NOEs with the protein protons are characterized by large negative cross-relaxation rates sigma NOE, which indicates that the residence times of the water molecules in these hydration sites are longer than ca. 10 ns. Additional experiments with extrinsic shift reagents established an upper limit of 20 ms at 4 degrees C for these residence times. Surface hydration of both the globular protein BPTI and the flexibly disordered polypeptide oxytocin is by water molecules with residence times in the subnanosecond range, as evidenced by small positive sigma NOE values observed for their NOEs with nearby polypeptide protons. Short residence times prevail for all surface hydration sites, independent of whether or not they are occupied by well ordered, X-ray observable water in the protein single crystals.},

abstract = {Hydrophobicity is often characterized macroscopically by the droplet contact angle. Molecular signatures of hydrophobicity have, however, remained elusive. Successful theories predict a drying transition leading to a vapor-like region near large hard-sphere solutes and interfaces. Adding attractions wets the interface with local density increasing with attractions. Here we present extensive molecular simulation studies of hydration of realistic surfaces with a wide range of chemistries from hydrophobic (-CF(3), -CH(3)) to hydrophilic (-OH, -CONH(2)). We show that the water density near weakly attractive hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., -CF(3)) can be bulk-like or larger, and provides a poor quantification of surface hydrophobicity. In contrast, the probability of cavity formation or the free energy of binding of hydrophobic solutes to interfaces correlates quantitatively with the macroscopic wetting properties and serves as an excellent signature of hydrophobicity. Specifically, the probability of cavity formation is enhanced in the vicinity of hydrophobic surfaces, and water-water correlations correspondingly display characteristics similar to those near a vapor-liquid interface. Hydrophilic surfaces suppress cavity formation and reduce the water-water correlation length. Our results suggest a potentially robust approach for characterizing hydrophobicity of more complex and heterogeneous surfaces of proteins and biomolecules, and other nanoscopic objects.},

abstract = {Transferring from laboratory frame to off-resonance rotating frame for the (1)H spin can compensate the relaxivity loss for paramagnetic agents at the magnetic field strength higher than 3 Tesla and enhance water relaxation rate constant significantly. A comprehensive theory for calculating the relaxation rate constants in the off-resonance rotating frame is described. This theory considers the contributions from both inner shell and outer shell water. The derived relaxation rate constants and relaxation enhancement efficiency as a function of the magnetic field strength and the effective field parameters are directly correlated to the structures, dynamics and environments of paramagnetic agents. To validate the theoretical predictions, we have measured the relaxation enhancement efficiency for a series of macromolecule conjugated gadolinium chelates at 9.4 Tesla. The experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions. The theory also predicts the relaxation enhancement for T(2)-type paramagnetic agents at high magnetic fields. Promising fields of applications include situations where T(1)- or T(2)-type paramagnetic agents are used for labeling molecular/cellular events.},

Using a recently introduced algorithm, we have quantitatively simulated previously published small-angle scattering data of hydrated Nafion. The characteristic 'ionomer peak' arises from long parallel but otherwise randomly packed water channels surrounded by partially hydrophilic side branches, forming inverted-micelle cylinders. At 20 vol\% water, the water channels have diameters of between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of 2.4 nm. Nafion crystallites (approximately 10 vol\%), which form physical crosslinks that are crucial for the mechanical properties of Nafion films, are elongated and parallel to the water channels, with cross-sections of approximately (5 nm)(2). Simulations for various other models of Nafion, including Gierke's cluster and the polymer-bundle model, do not match the scattering data. The new model can explain important features of Nafion, including fast diffusion of water and protons through Nafion and its persistence at low temperatures.},

Specifically, we examined the effects of glycerol, sucrose, PEG3000, and Ficoll400 for four commonly used nitroxide spin labels and found that the largest perturbations to the EPR line shapes occur for solutions containing PEG3000 and glycerol. From comparisons of the spectral line shapes and distance distribution profiles of spin-labeled HIV-1 protease with and without inhibitor, it was concluded that solutes such as glycerol and PEG3000 alter the line shapes of the spin label in the beta-hairpin flaps of HIV-1 PR by modulation of spin-label mobility through changes in preferential interactions with the solutes. It is noteworthy that the high osmolality of the 40\% glycerol solution did not alter the conformation of the flaps as determined from pulsed EPR distance measurements.},

This review considers the results obtained with a molecularly oriented spectroscopic method, i.e. electron spin resonance (ESR). The application of this technique in its various forms derived from continuous-wave (cw-ESR) and pulsed-wave (pw-ESR) modes are reviewed. In particular, carriers such as liposomes (intended for gene therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, oxymetry, and others), micelles, hydrogels, nanoparticles, dendrimers, cyclodextrins and cucurbit[n]urils are considered.},

However, the interfacial water acting as a separation medium on hydrophobic surfaces has never been detected and quantified experimentally. In this study, we show that small inorganic ions and organic molecules differentiate the interfacial water formed on the surfaces of octadecyl-bonded (C(18)) silica particles from the bulk water and the chemical separation of these solutes in aqueous media with hydrophobic materials can be interpreted with a consistent mechanism, partition between the bulk water phase and the interfacial water formed on the hydrophobic surface. Thermal transition behaviour of the interfacial water incorporated in the nanopores of the C(18) silica materials and the solubility parameter of the water calculated from the distribution coefficients of organic compounds have indicated that the interfacial water may have a structure of disrupted hydrogen bonding. The thickness of the interfacial water or the limit of distance from the hydrophobic surface at which molecules and ions can sense the surface was estimated to be 1.25 ± 0.13 nm from the volume of the interfacial water obtained by a liquid chromatographic method and the surface area, suggesting that the hydrophobic effect may extend beyond the first solvation shell of water molecules directly surrounding the surfaces.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that proteins at equilibrium can exist in a manifold of conformational substates, and that these substates play important roles in protein function. Therefore, there is great interest in identifying regions in proteins that are in conformational exchange. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled proteins containing the nitroxide side chain (R1) often consist of two (or more) components that may arise from slow exchange between conformational substates (lifetimes > 100 ns). However, crystal structures of proteins containing R1 have shown that multicomponent spectra can also arise from equilibria between rotamers of the side chain itself. In this report, it is shown that these scenarios can be distinguished by the response of the system to solvent perturbation with stabilizing osmolytes such as sucrose. Thus, site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) emerges as a new tool to explore slow conformational exchange in proteins of arbitrary size, including membrane proteins in a native-like environment. Moreover, equilibrium between substates with even modest differences in conformation is revealed, and the simplicity of the method makes it suitable for facile screening of multiple proteins. Together with previously developed strategies for monitoring picosecond to millisecond backbone dynamics, the results presented here expand the timescale over which SDSL can be used to explore protein flexibility.},

abstract = {Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) in the liquid state has become the focus of attention to improve the NMR sensitivity of mass limited samples. The Overhauser model predicts a fast reduction in DNP enhancement at high magnetic fields where the Electron Larmor frequency exceeds the typical inverse correlation time of the magnetic interaction between a radical spin and proton spins of the water molecules. Recent experiments have shown that an appreciable DNP enhancement in the liquid state is possible also at magnetic fields of 3 to 9 Tesla. At present it is not clear whether the Overhauser model needs to be adapted to explain these results. In the present paper we aim to resolve this question by a combination of in situ temperature dependent NMR relaxation measurements, EPR and DNP experiments. Enhancement factors of up to -165 are obtained with microwave powers below 500 mW. We conclude that at 3.4 Tesla (95 GHz) the various measurements are consistent with each other and in quantitative agreement with Overhauser theory. Microwave heating of the sample does play an important role to reduce the correlation times and allow a substantial Overhauser DNP. The typical enhancement factors may allow new applications in microfluidic NMR.},

By monitoring the self-diffusion behavior of water, the technique yields an estimate of the homogeneous length scale $\lambda$(hom), i.e. the maximum length scale at which there is local structural heterogeneity in a globally homogeneous material. A cross-over between local non-Gaussian to global Gaussian diffusion is observed by varying the experimentally defined length- and time-scales. Occasional observation of a weak Bragg peak in the PGSE signal attenuation curves permits the direct estimation of the MLV radius in favorable cases, thus yielding the constant of proportionality between $\lambda$(hom) and radius. The microstructural origin of the Bragg peak is verified through Brownian dynamics simulations and a theoretical analysis based on the center-of-mass diffusion propagator. $\lambda$(hom) is decreasing with increasing shear rate in agreement with theoretical expectations and results from (2)H NMR lineshape analysis.},

abstract = {Established pulse EPR approaches to the measurement of small dipole-dipole couplings between electron spins rely on constant-time echo experiments to separate relaxational contributions from dipolar time evolution. This requires a compromise between sensitivity and resolution to be made prior to the measurement, so that optimum data are only obtained if the magnitude of the dipole-dipole coupling is known beforehand to a good approximation. Moreover, the whole dipolar evolution function is measured with relatively low sensitivity. These problems are overcome by a variable-time experiment that achieves suppression of the relaxation contribution by reference deconvolution. Theoretical and experimental results show that this approach leads to significant sensitivity improvements for typical systems and experimental conditions. Further sensitivity improvements or, equivalently, an extension of the accessible distance range can be obtained by matrix deuteration or digital long-pass filtering of the time-domain data. Advantages and limitations of the new variable-time experiment are discussed by comparing it to the established analogous constant-time experiment for measurements of end-to-end distances of 5 and 7.5 nm on rod-like shape-persistent biradicals and for the measurement of a broadly distributed transmembrane distance in a doubly spin-labeled mutant of plant light harvesting complex II.},

The interpretation of the EPR and ESEEM spectra was facilitated by a theoretical analysis of the nuclear transition frequencies expected for the situation of the nuclear quadrupole interaction being much stronger than the Zeeman and hyperfine interactions. The isotropic hfi constant of 33S determined in these experiments was about 3 MHz, which demonstrates the presence of coordinated sulfate in the sulfite-reduced low-pH form of the plant enzyme.},

abstract = {When introduced into water, some molecules and ions (solutes) enforce the hydrogen-bonded network of neighboring water molecules that are thus restrained from thermal motions and are less mobile than those in the bulk phase (structure-making or positive hydration effect), and other solutes cause the opposite effect (structure-breaking or negative hydration effect). Using a method of microwave dielectric spectroscopy recently developed to measure the rotational mobility (dielectric relaxation frequency) of water hydrating proteins and the volume of hydration shells, the hydration of actin filament (F-actin) has been studied. The results indicate that F-actin exhibits both the structure-making and structure-breaking effects. Thus, apart from the water molecules with lowered rotational mobility that make up a typical hydration shell, there are other water molecules around the F-actin which have a much higher mobility than that of bulk water. No such dual hydration has been observed for myoglobin studied as the representative example of globular proteins which all showed qualitatively similar dielectric spectra. The volume fraction of the mobilized (hyper-mobile) water is roughly equal to that of the restrained water, which is two-thirds of the molecular volume of G-actin in size. The dielectric spectra of aqueous solutions of urea and potassium-halide salts have also been studied. The results suggest that urea and I(-) induce the hyper-mobile states of water, which is consistent with their well-known structure-breaking effect. The molecular surface of actin is rich in negative charges, which along with its filamentous structure provides a structural basis for the induction of a hyper-mobile state of water. A possible implication of the findings of the present study is discussed in relation to the chemomechanical energy transduction through interaction with myosin in the presence of ATP.},

abstract = {The dynamical coupling between proteins and their hydration water is important for the understanding of macromolecular function in a cellular context. In the case of membrane proteins, the environment is heterogeneous, composed of lipids and hydration water, and the dynamical coupling might be more complex than in the case of the extensively studied soluble proteins. Here, we examine the dynamical coupling between a biological membrane, the purple membrane (PM), and its hydration water by a combination of elastic incoherent neutron scattering, specific deuteration, and molecular dynamics simulations. Examining completely deuterated PM, hydrated in H(2)O, allowed the direct experimental exploration of water dynamics. The study of natural abundance PM in D(2)O focused on membrane dynamics. The temperature-dependence of atomic mean-square displacements shows inflections at 120 K and 260 K for the membrane and at 200 K and 260 K for the hydration water. Because transition temperatures are different for PM and hydration water, we conclude that ps-ns hydration water dynamics are not directly coupled to membrane motions on the same time scale at temperatures <260 K. Molecular-dynamics simulations of hydrated PM in the temperature range from 100 to 296 K revealed an onset of hydration-water translational diffusion at approximately 200 K, but no transition in the PM at the same temperature. Our results suggest that, in contrast to soluble proteins, the dynamics of the membrane protein is not controlled by that of hydration water at temperatures <260 K. Lipid dynamics may have a stronger impact on membrane protein dynamics than hydration water.},

abstract = {The interaction of dipyridamole (DIP) with reversed micelles (RM) of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) in CDCl3 at different water contents was studied. The position and T1 relaxation of the water peak upon addn. of extra water revealed three concn. ranges of CTAC: <10 mM (impurity water is mainly dispersed in CDCl3), >50-100 mM (water mainly inside the RM), and intermediate range. The resonances of CTAC protons in the polar layer broadened and displaced by up to 0.07 ppm as a function of CTAC concn. and extra water. At 10 mM CTAC, the addn. of 40 mM DIP shifted the head group signals to high field by about 0.1 ppm. At high and intermediate CTAC concns., four nitroxide spin probes, hydrophobic 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), hydrophilic 4-amine-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPAMINE), and lipophilic 5- and 16-doxyl stearic acids (5- and 16-DSA), underwent partial immobilization. The rotational correlation time of TEMPAMINE (rather than TEMPO, 5-, and 16-DSA) in RM moderately increased upon addn. of 1.5-2.0 mM DIP. At an excess of CTAC, only one DIP peak at 3.88 ppm remained measurable, and its selective T1 fell from 0.34 to 0.12 s. The assocn. const. for DIP and CTAC was between 10 and 35 m-1. Thus, DIP incorporates into the polar region of RM influencing packing and dynamics of surfactant head groups. In contrast, in aq. CTAC micelles, the preferential localization of DIP substituents is inside the nonpolar micelle core, and the binding const. is two orders of magnitude above that for RM. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Longitudinally detected ESR (LODESR) involves transverse ESR irradiation with a modulated source and observing oscillations in the spin magnetization parallel to the main magnetic field. In this study, radiofrequency-LODESR was used for oximetry by measuring the relaxation times of the electron. T-1e, and T-2e were measured by investigating LODESR signal magnitude as a function of detection frequency. We have also predicted theoretically and verified experimentally the LODESR signal phase dependence on detection frequency and relaxation times. These methods are valid even for inhomogeneous lines provided that T-1e much greater than T-2e. We have also developed a new method for measuring T-1e valid for inhomogeneous spectra, for all values of T-1e and T-2e, based on measuring the spectral area as a function of detection frequency. We have measured T-1e and T-2e for lithium phthalocyanine crystals, for the nitroxide TEMPOL, and for the single line agent Triarylmethyl (TAM). Furthermore, we have collected spectra from aqueous solutions of TEMPOL and TAM at different oxygen concentrations and confirmed that T-1e values are reduced with increased oxygen concentration. We have also measured the spin-lattice electronic relaxation time for degassed aqueous solutions of the same agents at different agent concentrations. T-1e decreases as a function of concentration for TAM while it remains independent of free radical concentration for TEMPOL, a major advantage for oxygen mapping. This method, combined with the ability of LODESR to provide images of exogenous free radicals in vivo, presents an attractive alternative to the conventional transverse ESR linewidth based oximetry methods.

At 200 K, the measured low frequency density of states of hydration water molecules of hydrophilic peptides is remarkably similar to that of high density amorphous ice, whereas, for hydrophobic biomolecules, it is comparable to that of low density amorphous ice behavior. In both hydrophilic and hydrophobic biomolecules, the high frequency modes show a blue shift of the libration mode as compared to the room temperature data. These results can be related to the density of water molecules around the biological interface, suggesting that the apparent local density of water is larger in a hydrophilic environment.},

abstract = {Prostasomes are human-specific lipid vesicles originating from the prostate and present in seminal plasma. They are involved in a no. of biol. functions such as sperm motility and immunomodulation by seminal plasma. The aim of our study was to investigate whether prostasomes play a role in the antioxidant status of seminal plasma. In cell suspensions obtained after elimination of seminal plasma by centrifugation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence were mainly produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The addn. of prostasomes to these cell suspensions lowered the overall ROS prodn. in the basal state and after stimulation with phorbol ester. This action could not be explained by a ROS-scavenging capacity of the prostasomes, as demonstrated by their inability to scavenge ROS produced by 2,2'-azobis-2-amidinopropane dihydrochloride. Using ESR, we could assess the influence of prostasomes on the plasma membranes of blood PMN and show that it was characterized by an increase in the correlation-relaxation time of the probe 16-doxyl-stearic acid inserted in the membranes. Thus, prostasomes caused a rigidification of blood PMN membranes. These results strongly suggest that the effect of prostasomes in semen could result from their interaction with PMN.

We have extended these time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance studies in purple membranes by analyzing conformational changes detected by a spin-label at another site in the C-D loop (103), and at sites in the A-B loop (35), the D-E loop (130), and the E-F loop (160). In addition, we have investigated the motion detected by a spin-label at site 101 in a D96A mutant background that has a prolonged M intermediate. We find that among the examined sites, only spin-labels in the C-D loop detect a significant change in the local environment after the rise of M. Although the D96A mutation dramatically prolongs the lifetime of the M intermediate, it does not perturb either the structure of bacteriorhodopsin or the nature of the light-activated conformational change detected by a spin-label at site 101. In this mutant, a conformational change is detected during the lifetime of M, when no change in the 410 nm absorbance is observed. These results provide direct structural evidence for the heterogeneity of the M population in real time, and demonstrate that the motion detected at site 101 occurs in M, prior to Schiff base reprotonation.},

The spheres had a mean diameter of 100 microm, thus providing an approximately constant characteristic pore dimension throughout the structures, while the use of two glass types ensured that water in different pore-space regions had significantly different T(2) relaxation rates. The packed beds were constructed in various ways with controlled glass type domain sizes to rigorously validate a model for region-to-region exchange of water. From the determined exchange times, the corresponding length scales were calculated based on the molecular self-diffusion of water; these agreed to better than +/-25\% with the expected domain sizes. Furthermore, exchange distances on the order of the pore size were observed in thoroughly mixed systems. Depending on the relaxation rates present in the sample, this technique can provide estimates of length scales ranging from microns to millimeters.},

abstract = {By means of differential scanning calorimetry and from a review of published data we demonstrate in this work that low-molecular weight kosmotropic substances (water-structure makers) of different chemical structure such as disaccharides, proline, and glycerol have identical effects on the phase behavior of several kinds of phospholipids and glycolipids. These substances favor formation of the high-temperature inverted hexagonal phase (H(II)) and the low-temperature lamellar crystalline (L(c)) and gel (L( $\beta$ )) phases at the expense of the intermediate lamellar liquid-crystalline phase (L( $\alpha$ )). The latter phase may completely disappear from the phase diagram at high enough solute concentration. By contrast, chaotropic substances (water-structure breakers) such as sodium thiocyanate and guanidine hydrochloride expand the existence range of L( $\alpha$ ) at the expense of the adjacent L( $\beta$ ) and H(II) phases. Moreover, chaotropes are able to induce the appearance of missing intermediate liquid-crystalline phases in lipids displaying direct L( $\beta$ )→H(II) transitions in pure water. In previous publications we have considered the influence of chaotropic and kosmotropic substances on the lipid phase behavior as a manifestation of their indirect (Hofmeister) interactions with the lipid aggregates. For a quantitative characterization of this effect, here we derive a general thermodynamic equation between lipid phase transition temperature and solute concentration, analogous to the Clapeyron-Clausius equation between transition temperature and pressure. It provides a clear description in physical quantities of the disparate effects of kosmotropic and chaotropic substances on the relative stability of the lipid-water phases. According to this equation, the magnitude of the solute effect is proportional to the hydration difference of the adjacent lipid phases and inversely proportional to the transition latent heat. The sign and magnitude of the transition shifts depend also on the degree of solute depletion (for kosmotropes) or enrichment (for chaotropes) at the interfaces, in comparison to the solute concentration in bulk water.},

abstract = {In this communication, we report enhancements of nuclear spin polarization by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in static and spinning solids at a magnetic field strength of 9 T (250 GHz for g = 2 electrons, 380 MHz for H-1). In these experiments, H-1 enhancements of up to 170 +/- 50 have been observed in I-C-13-glycine dispersed in a 60:40 glycerol/water matrix at temperatures of 20 K; in addition, we have observed significant enhancements in N-15 spectra of unoriented pf1-bacteriophage. Finally, enhancements of similar to17 have been obtained in two-dimensional C-13-C-13 chemical shift correlation spectra of the amino acid U-C-13, N-15-proline during magic angle spinning (MAS), demonstrating the stability of the DNP experiment for sustained acquisition and for quantitative experiments incorporating dipolar recoupling. In all cases, we have exploited the thermal mixing DNP mechanism with the nitroxide radical 4-amino-TEMPO as the paramagnetic dopant. These are the highest frequency DNP experiments performed to date and indicate that significant signal enhancements can be realized using the thermal mixing mechanism even at elevated magnetic fields. In large measure, this is due to the high microwave power output of the 250 GHz gyrotron oscillator used in these experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have investigated the dynamics of poly(vinly acetate) using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (DS) covering over 14 decades in frequency up to 20 GHz and high-resolution quasielastic neutron-scattering (QENS) technique. The dielectric results have been interpreted in terms of the phenomenological Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts [G. Williams and D. C. Watts, Trans. Faraday Soc. 66, 80 (1970); F. Alvarez, A. Alegria, and J. Colmenero, Phys. Rev. B 47, 125 (1993)] description. Because of the wide frequency range covered by DS, it provides a precise determination of dynamics over a wide temperature range and it revealed a crossover in polymer dynamics at 387 K through different dielectric parameters, viz., characteristic times, asymmetric shape parameter, and dielectric strength. Moreover, shape parameter is found to be higher in comparison to other typical polymeric systems. The characteristic relaxation times observed by QENS displayed an anomalous dependence of momentum transfer, indicating the possible existence of heterogeneities in the system even at the high temperatures. In addition, spin-lattice relaxation times, T(1), were found to be decoupled from dielectric characteristic times. Based on these results, a model was proposed to account for heterogeneities where we consider coexistence of different regions with standard polymeric behavior but with different characteristic times, leading to a distribution of relaxation times. The model is found to account for the anomalous behavior and an inherent shape parameter is found to account for the shape of alpha relaxation. This model is also found to predict the T variation of T(1) characteristic time scales at all temperatures. The origin of the heterogeneous domains is believed to lie in the microstructure of polymer chains.},

abstract = {Lipid-protein interactions are an important determinant of the stability and function of integral and transmembrane proteins. In addition to local interactions at the lipid-protein interface, global interactions such as the distribution of internal lateral pressure may also influence protein conformation. It is shown here that the effects of the membrane lateral pressure profile on the conformation or insertion of proteins in membranes are equivalent to the elastic response to the frustrated spontaneous curvature, c(o), of the component lipid monolayer leaflets. The chemical potential of the protein in the membrane is predicted to depend linearly on the spontaneous curvature of the lipid leaflets, just as does the contribution of the protein to the elastic bending energy of the lipid, and to be independent of the hydrophobic tension, gamma(phob), at the lipid-water interface. Analysis of the dependence of protein partitioning or conformational transitions on spontaneous curvature of the constituent lipids gives an experimental estimate for the cross-sectional intramembrane shape of the protein or its difference between conformations. Values in the region of 50-110 A(2) are estimated for the effective cross-sectional shape changes on the insertion and conductance transitions of alamethicin, and on the activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase or rhodopsin in lipid membranes. Much larger values are estimated for the mechanosensitive channel, MscL. Values for the change in intramembrane shape may also be used, together with determinations of lipid relative association constants, to estimate contributions of direct lipid-protein interactions to the lateral pressure experienced by the protein. Changes in chemical potential approximately 12 kJ mol(-1) can be estimated for radial changes of 1 A in a protein of diameter 40 A.},

abstract = {Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

abstract = {A noninvasive method for in vivo measurement of the oxygen concentration has been developed. By introducing a novel contrast medium (CM) based on a single electron substance, it is possible to enhance the proton signal through the Overhauser effect. A low-field magnetic resonance scanner is used to image the proton nuclei of the object. The electron spin transition of the CM is saturated using rf irradiation. As a consequence, the nuclear polarization becomes enhanced through dipole-dipole interaction. The signal enhancement is a function of rf power and of the EPR line width of the substance, which is influenced by the oxygen concentration. The maximum in vivo enhancement has been measured to 60. Image data, generated with different scanning parameters, is used in a postprocessing method to generate images showing pO2 and the contrast medium concentration, respectively. The mathematical foundation of the postprocessing algorithm is outlined. The results from phantom experiments and animal experiments, in which the oxygen content of the inspired gas was varied, are presented. The potential for human imaging is discussed. J. Magn. Reson.

abstract = {Oligomerization has important functional implications for many membrane proteins. However, obtaining structural insight into oligomeric assemblies is challenging, as they are large and resist crystallization. We focus on proteorhodopsin (PR), a protein with seven transmembrane $\alpha$-helices that was found to assemble to hexamers in densely packed lipid membrane, or detergent-solubilized environments. Yet, the structural organization and the subunit interface of these PR oligomers were unknown. We used site-directed spin-labeling together with electron spin-resonance lineshape and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization analysis to construct a model for the specific orientation of PR subunits within the hexameric complex. We found intersubunit distances to average 16 \AA between neighboring 55 residues and that residues 177 are >20 \AA apart from each other. These distance constraints show that PR has a defined and radial orientation within a hexamer, with the 55-site of the A-B loop facing the hexamer core and the 177-site of the E-F loop facing the hexamer exterior. Dynamic nuclear polarization measurements of the local solvent dynamics complement the electron spin-resonance-based distance analysis, by resolving whether protein surfaces at positions 55, 58, and 177 are exposed to solvent, or covered by protein-protein or protein-detergent contacts.},

abstract = {Measurements of the interfacial diffusion coefficient of the surface hydration layer of lipid vesicles in dilute solutions are presented. This was made possible by the greatly enhanced sensitivity and unique contrast provided by the site-specific and selective Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization of solvent molecules that approach nitroxide radical-based spin labels within <5-10 A. All experiments were carried out using minute microliter sample volumes of lipid vesicle solutions, using low spin label concentrations (<2 mol \%) and under physiological conditions. This presents unprecedented sensitivity for analyzing interfacial solvent diffusion of macromolecules and their assemblies in solutions and highlights the feasibility of investigating precious samples. Interfacial diffusion on DOTAP (1,2-DiOleoyl-3-TrimethylAmmonium-Propane) and DPPC (1,2-DiPalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCholine) surfaces are further analyzed as a function of temperature to determine the activation energy of their hydration layer dynamics. The temperature-dependent analysis across the phase transition of DPPC concludes that the hydration water with 100-200 ps dynamics displays Arrhenius behavior and does not undergo a phase transition unlike the lipid chains. We also discuss the advantages of determining the activation energy of diffusion as a general approach to comparing interfacial diffusivity on surfaces that have vastly different charge topologies and, thus, may display different distances of closest approach between the spin label placed at the surface and the protons of hydration water. The further development and application of this technique is expected to facilitate the study of membrane dynamics and their phase behavior, including the formation of lipid rafts, with lipid-specific resolution.},

abstract = {2D electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR) with the "full Sc-" method of analysis is applied to the study of plasma membrane vesicles. Membrane structural changes upon antigen cross-linking of IgE receptors (IgE-Fc$\epsilon$RI) in plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) isolated from RBL-2H3 mast cells are investigated, for the first time, by means of these 2D-ELDOR techniques. Spectra of 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine (16-PC) from PMVs before and after this stimulation at several temperatures are reported. The results demonstrate a coexistence of liquid-ordered (L(o)) and liquid-disordered (L(d)) components. We find that upon cross-linking, the membrane environment is remodeled to become more disordered, as shown by a moderate increase in the population of the L(d) component. This change in the relative amount of the L(o) versus L(d) components upon cross-linking is consistent with a model wherein the IgE receptors, which when clustered by antigen to cause cell stimulation, lead to more disordered lipids, and their dynamic and structural properties are slightly altered. This study demonstrates that 2D-ELDOR, analyzed by the full Sc- method, is a powerful approach for capturing the molecular dynamics in biological membranes. This is a particular case showing how 2D-ELDOR can be applied to study physical processes in complex systems that yield subtle changes.},

A DNP enhancement of -29 on water protons was obtained for an aqueous solution of Fremy's Salt; in comparison the previous highest value was -10 using a solid-state microwave power source (maximum power 45 mW). The increased enhancements are partly due to larger microwave saturation and elevated sample temperature. These experimentally observed DNP enhancements, which by far exceed the predicted values extrapolated from low-field DNP experiments, demonstrate experimentally that DNP is possible in the liquid state also at high magnetic fields.},

The higher coupling factor obtained at this field compared to higher magnetic fields, such as 0.35 T, directly translates to higher enhancement of the NMR signal and opens up a wider time scale window for observing water dynamics interacting with macromolecular systems, including proteins, polymers or lipid vesicles. The higher enhancements obtained will facilitate the observation of water dynamics at correlation times up to 10 ns, that corresponds to more than one order of magnitude slower dynamics than accessible at 0.35 T using X-band ESR frequencies.},

abstract = {We describe an experiment, in situ temperature jump dynamic nuclear polarization (TJ-DNP), that is demonstrated to enhance sensitivity in liquid-state NMR experiments of low-gamma spins - (13)C, (15)N, etc. The approach consists of polarizing a sample at low temperature using high-frequency (140 GHz) microwaves and a biradical polarizing agent and then melting it rapidly with a pulse of 10.6 mum infrared radiation, followed by observation of the NMR signal in the presence of decoupling. In the absence of polarization losses due to relaxation, the enhancement should be epsilon(dagger) = epsilon(T(obs)/T(mu)(wave)), where epsilon(dagger) is the observed enhancement, epsilon is the enhancement obtained at the temperature where the polarization process occurs, and T(mu)(wave) and T(obs) are the polarization and observation temperatures, respectively. In a single experimental cycle, we observe room-temperature enhancements, epsilon(dagger), of (13)C signals in the range 120-400 when using a 140 GHz gyrotron microwave source, T(mu)(wave) = 90 K, and T(obs) = 300 K. In addition, we demonstrate that the experiment can be recycled to perform signal averaging that is customary in contemporary NMR spectroscopy. Presently, the experiment is applicable to samples that can be repeatedly frozen and thawed. TJ-DNP could also serve as the initial polarization step in experiments designed for rapid acquisition of multidimensional spectra. [Journal Article; In English; United States; In-Process]},

All presented SL-heparins show high (1)H DNP enhancement factors up to E=-110, which validates that effectively more than one hyperfine line can be saturated even for spin-labeled polarizing agents. The parameters for the Overhauser-type DNP are determined and discussed. A striking result is that for spin-labeled heparins, the off-resonant electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) hyperfine lines contribute a non-negligible part to the total saturation, even in the absence of Heisenberg spin exchange (HSE) and electron spin-nuclear spin relaxation (T(1ne)).

abstract = {Molecules undergo non-Brownian diffusion in the plasma membrane, but the mechanism behind this anomalous diffusion is controversial. To characterize the anomalous diffusion in the complex system of the plasma membrane and to understand its underlying mechanism, single-molecule/particle methods that allow researchers to avoid ensemble averaging have turned out to be highly effective. However, the intrinsic problems of time-averaging (resolution) and the frequency of the observations have not been explored. These would not matter for the observations of simple Brownian particles, but they do strongly affect the observation of molecules undergoing anomalous diffusion. We examined these effects on the apparent motion of molecules undergoing simple, totally confined, or hop diffusion, using Monte Carlo simulations of particles undergoing short-term confined diffusion within a compartment and long-term hop diffusion between these compartments, explicitly including the effects of time-averaging during a single frame of the camera (exposure time) and the frequency of observations (frame rate). The intricate relationships of these time-related experimental parameters with the intrinsic diffusion parameters have been clarified, which indicated that by systematically varying the frame time and rate, the anomalous diffusion can be clearly detected and characterized. Based on these results, single-particle tracking of transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of live PtK2 cells were carried out, varying the frame time between 0.025 and 33 ms (0.03-40 kHz), which revealed the hop diffusion of the receptor between 47-nm (average) compartments with an average residency time of 1.7 ms, with the aid of single fluorescent-molecule video imaging.},

abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes the recent developments in both convention and hyperpolarized (HP) xenon NMR experiments. Xenon NMR has been used in a growing number of spectroscopy and imaging approaches to physical, chemical, and biological problems. Because of its sensitivity to chemical environment, its inertness, and now the ability to create high polarization through optical pumping xenon has become an extremely useful NMR nucleus to probe an enormous range of materials. Increasingly, we find that unusual materials are being examined with xenon NMR. In addition, more powerful computational methods are now available, making the calculation of xenon chemical shifts possible under a variety of experimentally simulated situations. Approximately half of the papers published over the past 7 years now involve the use of HP xenon because of the dramatic enhancement in sensitivity it affords, and because the optical pumping technology has become more routine. This advance has given rise to a significant increase in the papers that describe the use of 2D methods for xenon NMR as well as static and even dynamic imaging. Some of the rather exotic new methods that have been proposed recently promise to enhance the sensitivity and applicability of xenon NMR experiments well into the future.},

Potentiometric studies show an increased stability of the Gd(III) complex of H(3)bpatcn (logK(GdL)=15.8(2)) with respect to the Gd(III) complex of the analogous ligand 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N''-triacetic acid (H(3)nota) (logK(GdL)=13.7), associated with an increased selectivity of H(3)bpatcn for gadolinium over calcium. The H(3)bpatcn ligand sensitises the terbium ion very efficiently, leading to a long-lived and highly luminescent terbium complex (quantum yield=43 \%), in spite of the presence of a coordinated water molecule. (1)H proton NMR studies indicate that the metal ion is rigidly encapsulated by the three arms of the octadentate ligand H(3)bpatcn and that the macrocycle framework remains bound (through the five nitrogen and the three oxygen atoms) even at high temperature. A new theoretical method for interpreting the water proton relaxivity is presented. It is based on recent progresses in the description of the electronic spin relaxation and on an auxiliary probe solute. It replaces the Solomon, Bloembergen and Morgan (SBM) framework, which is questionable at low field, while avoiding resorting to simulations and/or sophisticated theories with additional unknown zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters. The inclusion of two picolinate groups on a triazacyclononane framework affords the mono-aquo gadolinium complex [Gd(bpatcn)(H(2)O)] with favourable electron-relaxation properties (tau(eff)(S0)=125 ps). The optimisation of the electronic relaxation by ligand design is especially important to achieve high relaxivity in the new generation macromolecular complexes with long rotational correlation times.},

abstract = {A review. Proton-electron double-resonance imaging (PEDRI) is an alternative method to EPR for detecting and imaging free radicals in biol. samples or animals. PEDRI uses the Overhauser effect, and involves collecting a proton NMR image while irradiating the EPR of the free radical under study. The spatial resoln. in PEDRI is not affected by the linewidth of the free radical's EPR resonance. An important development of the technique is field-cycled PEDRI (FC-PEDRI), in which the applied magnetic field is switched between two levels during the pulse sequence in order to decrease nonresonant RF power deposition and to increase sensitivity. A spectroscopic version of FC-PEDRI, called field-cycled dynamic nuclear polarization (FC-DNP) is useful for studying low concns. of free radicals and enables EPR spectra to be obtained via the Overhauser effect. This Chapter describes the techniques and practical implementation of PEDRI and related techniques. Applications of the methods are described, and likely future uses of the techniques are discussed.

Changes in the organization of small unilamellar vesicles were monitored either by ESR (EPR)-in the spectra of doxyl derivs. of stearic acid Me esters labeled at different positions in the acyl chain (5-, 7-, 12- and 16-MeSL)-or by fluorescence, with pyrene fatty-acid (4-, 6-, 10- and 16-Py) probes. The largest effects were obsd. with labels located at the upper positions of the fatty-acid acyl-chain. Dynamic information was obtained by 1H-NMR. Lidocaine protons presented shorter longitudinal relaxation times (T1) values due to their binding, and consequent immobilization to the membrane. In the presence of lidocaine the mobility of all glycerol protons of EPC decreased, while the choline protons revealed a higher degree of mobility, indicating a reduced participation in lipid-lipid interactions. Two-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser Effect expts. detected contacts between arom. lidocaine protons and the phospholipid-choline Me group. Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy spectra revealed that lidocaine changes the access of water to the glycerol region of the bilayer. A $\backslash$"transient site$\backslash$" model for lidocaine preferential location in EPC bilayers is proposed. The model is based on the consideration that insertion of the bulky arom. ring of the anesthetic into the glycerol backbone region causes a decrease in the mobility of that EPC region (T1 data) and an increased mobility of the acyl chains (EPR and fluorescence data).

The viscosity in the micelle, calcd. from the rotational correlation time using the Stokes-Einstein equation, showed that it increases .apprx.2.5 times at 3000 atm pressure. In an egg phosphatidylcholine bilayer, the effect of pressure was far larger than that in the micelle. The three-line spectrum at 1 atm became the rigid-limit one at 2900 atm, suggesting that the liq.-cryst. state changes into the gel state with an increase in pressure. The effect of pressure on the viscosities in the micelle and the lipid membrane is discussed by comparison with those of water and dodecane. In a dilauroylphosphatidylcholine bilayer, the spin probe gradually segregates from the bilayer with increasing pressure, showing that phase sepn. takes place in the lipid bilayer with increasing pressure.

The development of methods to crystallize bacteriorhodopsin have allowed it to be studied with high-resolution X-ray diffraction, opening the possibility to advance substantially our knowledge of the structure and mechanism of this light-driven proton pump. A key step is to obtain the structures of the intermediate states formed during the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin. One difficulty in these studies is how to trap selectively the intermediates at low temperatures and determine quantitatively their amounts in a photosteady state. In this paper we review the procedures for trapping the K, L, M and N intermediates of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle and describe the difference absorption spectra accompanying the transformation of the all-trans-bacteriorhodopsin into each intermediate. This provides the means for quantitative analysis of the light-induced mixtures of different intermediates produced by illumination of the pigment at low temperatures.},

Low power pulses can be as short as 200 ps and kilowatt pulses as short as 1.5 ns with timing resolution of a few hundred picoseconds. Phase and frequency can be changed on nanosecond time scales and complex high power pulse sequences can be run at repetition rates up to 80 kHz with low dead time. We demonstrate that the combination of high power pulses at high frequencies and nonresonant cavities can offer excellent concentration sensitivity for orientation selective pulsed electron double resonance (double electron-electron resonance), where we demonstrate measurements at 1 microM concentration levels.},

abstract = {The first two-dimensional Fourier-transform electron spin resonance (2D-FT-ESR) studies of nitroxide-labeled lipids in membrane vesicles are reported. The considerable enhancement this experiment provides for extracting rotational and translational diffusion rates, as well as orientational ordering parameters by means of ESR spectroscopy, is demonstrated. The 2D spectral analysis is achieved using theoretical simulations that are fit to experiments by an efficient and automated nonlinear least squares approach. These methods are applied to dispersions of 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (POPC) model membranes utilizing spin labels 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine and the 3-doxyl derivative of cholestan-3-one (CSL). Generally favorable agreement is obtained between the results obtained by 2D-FT-ESR on vesicles with the previous results on similar systems studied by continuous wave (cw) ESR on aligned samples. The precision in determining the dynamic and ordering parameters is significantly better for 2D-FT-ESR, even though the cw ESR spectra from membrane vesicles are resolved more poorly than those from well aligned samples. Some small differences in results by the two methods are discussed in terms of limitations of the methods and/or theoretical models, as well as possible differences between dynamic molecular structure in vesicles versus aligned membranes. An interesting observation with CSL/POPC, that the apparent homogeneous linewidths seem to increase in "real time," is tentatively attributed to the effects of slow director fluctuations in the membrane vesicles.},

The ESR results showed that the headgroups of SDS adsorbed on PEG were more tightly packed than those of the unperturbed micelles and a more compact structure was formed at the binding site of the polymer-micelle aggregate due to a strong decrease of the viscosity at the micelle-polymer interface.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

abstract = {Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice to study paramagnetic cofactors that often play an important role as active centers in electron transfer processes in biological systems. However, in many cases more than one paramagnetic species is contributing to the observed EPR spectrum, making the analysis of individual contributions difficult and in some cases impossible. With time-domain techniques it is possible to exploit differences in the relaxation behavior of different paramagnetic species to distinguish between them and separate their individual spectral contribution. Here we give an overview of the use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). While FeS cluster N1 can be studied individually at a temperature of 30 K, this is not possible for FeS cluster N2 due to its severe spectral overlap with cluster N1. In this case Relaxation Filtered Hyperfine (REFINE) spectroscopy can be used to separate the overlapping spectra based on differences in their relaxation behavior.},

We demonstrate that covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricated and intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-porous sub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionality such that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and gas uptakes for the latter exceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous or non-porous polymorphs with apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m2 g(-1), respectively. These results suggest design principles for responsive porous organic solids and for the modular construction of extended materials from prefabricated molecular pores.},

abstract = {We present a unique analysis tool for the selective detection of local water inside soft molecular assemblies (hydrophobic cores, vesicular bilayers, and micellar structures) suspended in bulk water. Through the use of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), the (1)H NMR signal of water is amplified, as it interacts with stable radicals that possess approximately 658 times higher spin polarization. We utilized stable nitroxide radicals covalently attached along the hydrophobic tail of stearic acid molecules that incorporate themselves into surfactant-based micelle or vesicle structures. Here, we present a study of local water content and fluid viscosity inside oleate micelles and vesicles and Triton X-100 micelles to serve as model systems for soft molecular assemblies. This approach is unique because the amplification of the NMR signal is performed in bulk solution and under ambient conditions with site-specific spin labels that only detect the water that is directly interacting with the localized spin labels. Continuous wave (cw) electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis provides rotational dynamics of the spin-labeled molecular chain segments and local polarity parameters that can be related to hydration properties, whereas we show that DNP-enhanced (1)H NMR analysis of fluid samples directly provides translational water dynamics and permeability of the local environment probed by the spin label. Our technique therefore has the potential to become a powerful analysis tool, complementary to cw ESR, to study hydration characteristics of surfactant assemblies, lipid bilayers, or protein aggregates, where water dynamics is a key parameter of their structure and function. In this study, we find that there is significant penetration of water inside the oleate micelles with a higher average local water viscosity (approximately 1.8 cP) than in bulk water, and Triton X-100 micelles and oleate vesicle bilayers mostly exclude water while allowing for considerable surfactant chain motion and measurable water permeation through the soft structure.},

abstract = {Continuous thermometry during a hyperthermic procedure may help to correct for local differences in heat conduction and energy absorption, and thus allow optimization of the thermal therapy. Noninvasive, three-dimensional mapping of temperature changes is feasible with magnetic resonance (MR) and may be based on the relaxation time T(1), the diffusion coefficient (D), or proton resonance frequency (PRF) of tissue water. The use of temperature-sensitive contrast agents and proton spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The principles and performance of these methods are reviewed in this paper. The excellent linearity and near-independence with respect to tissue type, together with good temperature sensitivity, make PRF-based temperature MRI the preferred choice for many applications at mid to high field strength (>/= 1 T). The PRF methods employ radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo imaging methods. A standard deviation of less than 1 degrees C, for a temporal resolution below 1 second and a spatial resolution of about 2 mm, is feasible for a single slice for immobile tissues. Corrections should be made for temperature-induced susceptibility effects in the PRF method. If spin-echo methods are preferred, for example when field homogeneity is poor due to small ferromagnetic parts in the needle, the D- and T(1)-based methods may give better results. The sensitivity of the D method is higher that that of the T(1) methods provided that motion artifacts are avoided and the trace of D is evaluated. Fat suppression is necessary for most tissues when T(1), D, or PRF methods are employed. The latter three methods require excellent registration to correct for displacements between scans.},

abstract = {We have studied the effects of macromolecular crowding on protein folding kinetics by studying the oxidative refolding of hen lysozyme in the absence and presence of high concentrations of bovine serum albumin and Ficoll 70. The heterogeneity characteristic of the lysozyme refolding process is preserved under crowded conditions. This, together with the observation that the refolding intermediates that accumulate to significant levels are very similar in the absence and presence of Ficoll, suggests that crowding does not alter substantially the energetics of the protein folding reaction. However, the presence of high concentrations of macromolecules results in the acceleration of the fast track of the refolding process whereas the slow track is substantially retarded. The results can be explained by preferential excluded volume stabilization of compact states relative to more unfolded states, and suggest that, relative to dilute solutions, the rates of many protein folding processes are likely to be altered under conditions that more closely resemble the intracellular environment.},

abstract = {The unnatural, conformationally constrained nitroxide amino acid TOAC (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid) stabilizes helical structure and provides a means for studying rigidly spin labeled peptides by electron spin resonance (ESR). Two new directions in TOAC research are described. The first investigates intermediates formed during -helix unfolding. Double TOAC labeled -helical peptides were unfolded at low temperature in aqueous solution with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. Comparison of ESR spectra from two doubly labeled peptides suggests that 310-helix emerges as an intermediate. The second research direction involves the use of high frequency ESR (140 GHz) at low temperature to assess dipolar couplings and, hence, distances between TOAC pairs in a series of 310-helical peptides. Preliminary simulations suggest that high frequency ESR is able to extract correct distances between 6 and 11 \AA. In addition, the spectra appear to be very sensitive to the relative orientation of the TOAC labels. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Biopolymers (Pept Sci) 55: 479-485, 2000},

abstract = {Most proteins function in nature under crowded conditions, and crowding can change protein properties. Quantification of crowding effects, however, is difficult because solutions containing hundreds of grams of macromolecules per liter often interfere with the observation of the protein being studied. Models for macromolecular crowding tend to focus on the steric effects of crowders, neglecting potential chemical interactions between the crowder and the test protein. Here, we report the first systematic, quantitative, residue-level study of crowding effects on the equilibrium stability of a globular protein. We used a system comprising poly(vinylpyrrolidone)s (PVPs) of varying molecular weights as crowding agents and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) as a small globular test protein. Stability was quantified with NMR-detected amide (1)H exchange. We analyzed the data in terms of hard particle exclusion, confinement, and soft interactions. For all crowded conditions, nearly every observed residue experiences a stabilizing effect. The exceptions are residues for which stabilities are unchanged. At a PVP concentration of 100 g/L, the data are consistent with theories of hard particle exclusion. At higher concentrations, the data are more consistent with confinement. The data show that the crowder also stabilizes the test protein by weakly binding its native state. We conclude that the role of native-state binding and other soft interactions needs to be seriously considered when applying both theory and experiment to studies of macromolecular crowding.},

abstract = {The measurement of spin-lattice relaxation rates from spin labels, such as nitroxides, in the presence and absence of spin relaxants provides information that is useful for determining biomolecular properties such as nucleic acid dynamics and the interaction of proteins with membranes. We compare X-band continuous wave (CW) and pulsed or time domain (TD) EPR methods for obtaining spin-lattice relaxation rates of spin labels across the entire range of rotational motion to which relaxation rates are sensitive. Model nitroxides and spin-labeled biological species are used to illustrate the potential complications that arise in extracting relaxation data under conditions typical to biological experiments. The effect of super hyperfine (SHF) structure is investigated for both CW and TD spectra. First and second harmonic absorption and dispersion CW spectra of the nitroxide spin label, TEMPOL, are all fit simultaneously to a model of SHF structure over a range of microwave amplitudes. The CW spectra are novel because all harmonics and microwave phases were acquired simultaneously using our homebuilt CW/TD spectrometer. The effect of the SHF structure on the pulsed free induction decay (FID) and pulsed saturation recovery spectrum is shown for both protonated and deuterated TEMPOL. We present novel pulsed saturation recovery measurements on biological molecules, including spin-lattice relaxation rates of spin-labeled proteins and spin-labeled double-stranded DNA. The impact of structure and dynamics on relaxation rates are discussed in the context of each of these examples. Collisional relaxation rates with oxygen and transition metal paramagnetic relaxants are extracted using both continuous wave and time domain methods. The extent of the errors inherent in the CW method and the advantages of pulsed methods for unambiguously measuring collisional relaxation rates are discussed. Spin-lattice relaxation rates, determined by both CW and pulsed methods, are used to determine the electrostatic potential on the surface of a protein.},

The PDMS blocks in MB1 and MB2 had 12 and 2 repeat units, resp. The nitroxide spin probe used was 5-doxyl-decane (5DD). As ref., the ESR spectra of the probe were measured in water, aq. PDMS, aq. PMA, and aq. PDMS and PMA mixts. The 14N isotropic hyperfine splitting, aN, varied between 14.1 G in PDMS solns. (nonpolar media) to 15.8 G in PMA solns. Two spectra components were detected in MB1 (long PDMS blocks); in MB2 (shorter PDMS blocks) the probe was present in three regions: hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and a slow PDMS component with extreme sepn. of 64 G. Spectra simulation and quant. detn. of the intensity ratio of the probe in the various sites were interpreted in terms of different micellization mechanisms for the two systems: a one stage micellization for MB1, and a two stage micellization for MB2: the size of the blocks affects not only the CMC, but also the micellization process.

The generated echoes quickly assume an asymptotic shape that encodes the information of interest. High signal-to-noise ratios can be achieved by averaging the large number of echoes. We demonstrate this approach with different implementations of the measurements of longitudinal relaxation time, T(1), and diffusion coefficient, D.

Poly(4-vinylbenzyloxy-TEMPO)-block-polystyrene (PTEMPO-b-PSt) formed spherical micelles in carbon tetrachloride, a nonselective solvent by the reaction with chlorine. UV and ESR analyses demonstrated that the micellization occurred through the oxidn. of the TEMPO by the chlorine to insol. oxoaminium chloride (OAC), the one-electron oxidant of TEMPO. The resulting POAC-b-PSt micelles served as a one-electron oxidizing agent for N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine to produce Wurster's blue chloride, reverting themselves to the PTEMPO-b-PSt unimers. The micelles also acted as a two-electron oxidizing agent for benzyl alc. to benzaldehyde. In this oxidn., no dissocn. of the micelles occurred because the OAC was converted to the insol. hydroxylamine-hydrochloride salt. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {DNA is depicted in elementary chemistry and biology texts as a perfect double helix; but local structural variations and nanoscale motions within the double helix are critical for its ability to be packaged, recognized, and transcribed. DNA is becoming a favored nanoscale assembly tool due to the precise pairing of complementary strands that in principle can bring nanoscale objects within a well-defined distance of each other. However, future nanotechnology applications of DNA need to take into account its variable nanoscale structural and dynamic properties, especially in terms of its solvent shell and counterions. This article highlights efforts of the authors to (1) interrogate nanoscale structures of DNA using nanoparticles and (2) measure the dynamic nature of DNA over six orders of magnitude in time, using a fluorescent reporter in the base stack.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The influence of liposome composition on the bilayer fluidity and on the transport of encapsulated substance into the skin was investigated. METHODS: Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with various amounts of cholesterol were prepared by the film method and characterised by photon correlation spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. The transport of the hydrophilic spin probe encapsulated in MLV into pig ear skin was investigated by EPR imaging methods. The bilayer domain structure was studied by fitting the lineshape of the experimental EPR spectra with the spectra calculated by the model, which takes into account the heterogeneous structure of the bilayer with several coexisting domains. RESULTS: Cholesterol strongly influences the entrapped volume of liposomes, the domain structure of the lipid bilayer, and the transport of hydrophilic spin probe into the skin. Transport was not observed for liposomes composed of phospholipid:cholesterol 1:0 or 9:1 (mol:mol), not even above the phase transition temperature from the gel to the liquid crystalline phase of DMPC. A significant delivery of hydrophilic spin probe was observed only if there was 30 or 50 mol\% of cholesterol in the liposome bilayer. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the domain structure of the liposome bilayer is more important for the delivery of encapsulated substance into the skin than the liquid crystalline phase of the pure phospholipids bilayer.},

abstract = {New improved pH-sensitive nitroxides were applied for in vivo studies. An increased stability of the probes towards reduction was achieved by the introduction of the bulky ethyl groups in the vicinity of the paramagnetic N-O fragment. In addition, the range of pH sensitivity of the approach was extended by the synthesis of probes with two ionizable groups, and, therefore, with two pK(a) values. Stability towards reduction and spectral characteristics of the three new probes were determined in vitro using 290 MHz radiofrequency (RF)- and X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), longitudinally detected EPR (LODEPR), and field-cycled dynamic nuclear polarization (FC-DNP) techniques. The newly synthesized probe, 4-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-pyridine-4-yl-2,5,5-triethyl-2,5-,dihydro-1H-imidazol-oxyl, was found to be the most appropriate for the application in the stomach due to both higher stability and convenient pH sensitivity range from pH 1.8 to 6. LODEPR, FC-DNP and proton-electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) techniques were used to detect the nitroxide localization and acidity in the rat stomach. Improved probe characteristics allowed us to follow in vivo the drug-induced perturbation in the stomach acidity and its normalization afterwards during I h or longer period of time. The results show the applicability of the techniques for monitoring drug pharmacology and disease in the living animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Internal motion is central to protein folding, to protein stability through the resulting residual entropy, and to protein function. Despite its importance, the precise nature of the internal motions of protein macromolecules remains a mystery. Here we report a survey of the temperature dependence of the fast dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains in a calmodulin-peptide complex using site-specific deuterium NMR relaxation methods. The amplitudes of motion had a markedly heterogeneous spectrum and segregated into three largely distinct classes. Other proteins studied at single temperatures tend to segregate similarly. Furthermore, a large variability in the degree of thermal activation of the dynamics in the calmodulin complex indicates a heterogeneous distribution of residual entropy and hence reveals the microscopic origins of heat capacity in proteins. These observations also point to an unexpected explanation for the low-temperature 'glass transition' of proteins. It is this transition that has been ascribed to the creation of protein motional modes that are responsible for biological activity.},

abstract = {Despite increased attention, little is known about how the crowded intracellular environment affects basic phenomena like protein diffusion. Here, we use NMR to quantify the rotational and translational diffusion of a 7.4-kDa test protein, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), in solutions of glycerol, synthetic polymers, proteins, and cell lysates. As expected, translational diffusion and rotational diffusion decrease with increasing viscosity. In glycerol, for example, the decrease follows the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye laws. Synthetic polymers cause negative deviation from the Stokes laws and affect translation more than rotation. Surprisingly, however, protein crowders have the opposite effect, causing positive deviation and reducing rotational diffusion more than translational diffusion. Indeed, bulk proteins severely attenuate the rotational diffusion of CI2 in crowded protein solutions. Similarly, CI2 diffusion in cell lysates is comparable to its diffusion in crowded protein solutions, supporting the biological relevance of the results. The rotational attenuation is independent of the size and total charge of the crowding protein, suggesting that the effect is general. The difference between the behavior of synthetic polymers and protein crowders suggests that synthetic polymers may not be suitable mimics of the intracellular environment. NMR relaxation data reveal that the source of the difference between synthetic polymers and proteins is the presence of weak interactions between the proteins and CI2. In summary, weak but nonspecific, noncovalent chemical interactions between proteins appear to fundamentally impact protein diffusion in cells.},

Supplemented by suitable intramolecular cross-relaxation, longitudinal relaxation, and self-diffusion data, the obtained cross-relaxation rates are evaluated within the framework of recent relaxation models and provide information about the hydrophobic hydration. In particular, water dynamics around the trifluoromethyl group in ammonium perfluoro-octanoate are more retarded than that in the smaller trifluoroacetate. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The spectrum was obtained at room temperature in a 5 T magnetic field, where the conduction electron spin resonance frequency is 140 GHz.  A simple theory that accounts for the salient aspects of this pulsed DNP technique is presented.  In systems where Overhauser mechanisms dominate the DNP, this new pulsed method can produce enhancements which are comparable to or greater than those obtained with conventional cw irradiation techniques, with lower average microwaves powers.},

abstract = {Instrumental drift in atomic force microscopy (AFM) remains a critical, largely unaddressed issue that limits tip-sample stability, registration, and the signal-to-noise ratio during imaging. By scattering a laser off the apex of a commercial AFM tip, we locally measured and thereby actively controlled its three-dimensional position above a sample surface to <40 pm (Deltaf = 0.01-10 Hz) in air at room temperature. With this enhanced stability, we overcame the traditional need to scan rapidly while imaging and achieved a 5-fold increase in the image signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we demonstrated atomic-scale ( approximately 100 pm) tip-sample stability and registration over tens of minutes with a series of AFM images on transparent substrates. The stabilization technique requires low laser power (<1 mW), imparts a minimal perturbation upon the cantilever, and is independent of the tip-sample interaction. This work extends atomic-scale tip-sample control, previously restricted to cryogenic temperatures and ultrahigh vacuum, to a wide range of perturbative operating environments.},

abstract = {This paper concerns instrumental approaches to obtain large dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancements in a completely portable system. We show that at fields of 0.35 T under ambient conditions and at X-band frequencies, 1H enhancements of >100-fold can be achieved using nitroxide radical systems, which is near the theoretical maximum for 1H polarization using the Overhauser effect at this field. These large enhancements were obtained using a custom built microwave transmitter and a commercial TE102 X-band resonant cavity. The custom built microwave transmitter is compact, so when combined with a permanent magnet it is readily transportable. Our commercial X-band resonator was modified to be tunable over a range of approximately 9.5-10 GHz, giving added versatility to our fixed field portable DNP system. In addition, a field adjustable Halbach permanent magnet has also been employed as another means for matching the electron spin resonance condition. Both portable setups provide large signal enhancements and with improvements in design and engineering, greater than 100-fold 1H enhancements are feasible.},

abstract = {Water absorption, membrane swelling, and self-diffusivity of water in 1100 equivalent weight Nafion were measured as functions of temperature and water activity. Free volume per water at 80 °C, determined from water uptake and volume expansion data, decreases with water content in the membrane from 12 cm(3)/mol at $\lambda$ = 0.5 H(2)O/SO(3) to 1.5 cm(3)/mol at $\lambda$ = 4. The change in free volume with water content displays a transition at $\lambda$ = 4. Limiting water self-diffusivity in Nafion was determined by pulsed gradient spin echo NMR at long delay times. The limiting self-diffusivity increases exponentially with water activity; the rate of increase of diffusivity with water content shows a transition at $\lambda$ = 4. The tortuosity of the hydrophilic domains in Nafion decreased from 20 at low membrane water activity to 3 at $\lambda$ = 4. It suggested a change in the connectivity of the hydrophilic domains absorbed water occurs at $\lambda$ ∼ 4. The diffusivity results were employed to separate the contributions of diffusional and interfacial resistance for water transport across Nafion membranes, which enabled the determination of the interfacial mass transport coefficients. A diffusion model was developed which incorporated activity-dependent diffusivity, volume expansion, and the interfacial resistance, and was used to resolve the water activity profiles in the membrane.},

After assignment, proton-proton NOEs are used for the shell where 1H spectra are conveniently observed. In a shell closer to the metal ion, 13C NMR spectra with band-selective homonuclear decoupling provide the assignment of all nuclei except for those of the metal ligands. A convenient method for the measurement of 13C longitudinal-relaxation rates (R1) of carbonyls and carboxylate moieties is proposed. 1H NOEs and 1H and 13C R1 data are sufficient to produce a good/reasonable solution structure, as demonstrated for a monomeric species of superoxide dismutase, a 153-residue protein.},

abstract = {The intensities of saturation-transfer EPR (ST-EPR) spectra from nitroxyl spin labels have proved a sensitive means for studying slow exchange processes (both Heisenberg spin exchange and physical/chemical exchange) and weak interactions with paramagnetic ions, via the dependence on the effective spin-lattice relaxation rate (D. Marsh,Appl. Magn. Reson.3, 53, 1992). The dependences of the second-harmonic EPR absorption intensities detected in phase quadrature with the field modulation (V'2) on the microwaveH1field, and on the effective relaxation times, were studied both theoretically and experimentally. Power-saturation curves and normalized integrated intensities (IST) of theV'2spectra were determined as a function of the concentration of a spin-labeled phospholipid in lipid membranes and of the concentration of paramagnetic Ni2+ions in the aqueous phase as a means of varying the effective relaxation times. The results were correlated with progressive-saturation measurements of the double-integrated intensities of the conventional EPR spectra. Intensities of theV'2spectra were calculated from the Bloch equations incorporating the modulation and microwave fields (K. Halbach,Helv. Phys. Acta27, 259, 1954), and the results were fitted to the experimental data. The ST-EPR intensities depend approximately linearly on the effectiveT1, but with a nonzero intercept. On the basis of the theoretical calculations and experimental correlations, relations betweenISTandT1are suggested that may improve precision in the application of this alternative form of ST-EPR spectroscopy to biological systems.},

abstract = {The function of many proteins involves equilibria between conformational substates, and to elucidate mechanisms of function it is essential to have experimental tools to detect the presence of conformational substates and to determine the time scale of exchange between them. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) has the potential to serve this purpose. In proteins containing a nitroxide side chain (R1), multicomponent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra can arise either from equilibria involving different conformational substates or rotamers of R1. To employ SDSL to uniquely identify conformational equilibria, it is thus essential to distinguish between these origins of multicomponent spectra. Here we show that this is possible based on the time scale for exchange of the nitroxide between distinct environments that give rise to multicomponent EPR spectra; rotamer exchange for R1 lies in the ≈0.1-1 $\mu$s range, while conformational exchange is at least an order of magnitude slower. The time scales of exchange events are determined by saturation recovery EPR, and in favorable cases, the exchange rate constants between substates with lifetimes of approximately 1-70 $\mu$s can be estimated by the approach.},

Control over proteolysis by the 20S core-particle (CP) proteasome is achieved by gated access of substrate; thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism by which these gates regulate substrate entry is critical. We used methyl-transverse relaxation optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that the amino-terminal residues that compose the gates of the alpha subunits of the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome are highly dynamic over a broad spectrum of time scales and that gating termini are in conformations that extend either well inside (closed gate) or outside (open gate) of the antechamber. Interconversion between these conformers on a time scale of seconds leads to a dynamic regulation of 20S CP proteolysis activity.},

Increases in the aluminum content and evacuation temperature resulted in significant increases in the 129Xe NMR line width and chemical shift of xenon adsorbed on HZSM-5. Similarly, the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal at g=2.000+/-0.005 increased in intensity with increasing Al content or evacuation temperature. In the case of NaZSM-5, evacuation at high temperature did not affect the 129Xe NMR spectrum, and the ESR signal disappeared. These results are attributed to paramagnetic solid-state defects in HZSM-5 arising from the hydroxyl groups that bridge the Al and Si atoms in the zeolite framework.},

abstract = {Proton electron double resonance imaging (PEDRI) uses the Overhauser effect to image the distribution of free-radicals in biological samples and animals. Standard MRI hardware and software is used, with the addition of hardware to irradiate the free-radical-of-interest's EPR resonance. For in vivo applications it must be implemented at a sufficiently low magnetic field to result in an EPR irradiation frequency that will penetrate the sample but will not cause excessive nonresonant power deposition therein. Many clinical MRI systems use resistive magnets that are capable of operating at 10-20 mT, and which could thus be used as PEDRI imagers with the addition of a small amount of extra hardware. This article describes the conversion of a 0.38 T whole-body MRI system for operation as a 20.1 mT small-animal PEDRI imager. The magnet power supply control electronics required a small modification to operate at the lower field strength, but no permanent hardware changes to the MRI console were necessary, and no software modification was required. Frequency down- and up-conversion was used on the NMR RF system, together with a new NMR/EPR dual-resonance RF coil assembly. The system was tested on phantoms containing free-radical solution, and was also used to image the distribution of a free-radical contrast agent injected intravenously into anesthetized mice.

Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory predict a structure that reproduces the experimentally determined hyperfine tensors. The radicals are propeller-shaped with the three aryl rings nearly mutually orthogonal. The central carbon atom carrying most of the unpaired electron spin density is surrounded by the sulfur atoms in the radical and is completely shielded from solvent. This structure explains features of the electron spin relaxation of these radicals and suggests ways in which the radicals can be chemically modified to improve their characteristics for imaging and oximetry.},

The results reported here corroborate and extend the results of earlier experiments with fluorescein-labeled, size-fractionated dextran: diffusion of nonbinding particles in cytoplasm is hindered in a size-dependent manner. Extrapolation of the data suggests that particles larger than 260 A in radius may be completely nondiffusible in the cytoplasmic space. In contrast, diffusion of Ficoll in protein solutions of concentration comparable to the range reported for cytoplasm is not hindered in a size-dependent manner. Although we cannot at present distinguish among several physical chemical models for the organization of cytoplasm, these results make it clear that cytoplasm possesses some sort of higher-order intermolecular interactions (structure) not found in simple aqueous protein solutions, even at high concentration. These results also suggest that, for native cytoplasmic particles whose smallest radial dimension approaches 260 A, size may be as important a determinant of cytoplasmic diffusibility as binding specificity. This would include most endosomes, polyribosomes, and the larger multienzyme complexes.},

abstract = {The identification of solid-state defects on calcined H-ZSM-5 powder is discussed in terms of positive holes on oxygen atoms between the tetrahedral structure of silica-alumina. Photoelectron studies of water molecules add new insight into the localized nature of the unpaired electron on the solid-state defects. A charge transfer mechanism between the unsaturated organic molecules and these defects is responsible for the subsequent chemical events. Intramolecular rearrangement of the 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene radical cation yields a more stable 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene isomer radical cation, whereas aromatization of the 2-butyne radical cation forms hexamethylbenzene radical cation at higher temperatures. On the basis of direct observations of these chemical reactions, both the solid-state defects and various pathways of radical cations should play an interesting role in understanding zeolite catalysis.},

abstract = {Long pulse saturation recovery electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is applied to the investigation of spin-labeled side chains placed along a regular helix extending from 128 to 135 in T4 lysozyme. Under an argon atmosphere, analysis of the exponential saturation recovery curves gives the spin-lattice relaxation rates of the nitroxides, which depend on the nitroxide side-chain dynamics. In the presence of the fast-relaxing paramagnetic reagents O(2) or NiEDDA, global analysis of the saturation recovery provides the spin-lattice relaxation rates as well as the Heisenberg exchange rates of the nitroxide with the reagents. As previously shown with power saturation methods, such exchange rates are direct measures of the solvent accessibility of the nitroxide side chains in the protein structure. The periodic dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates and the exchange rates along the 128-135 sequence reveal the presence of the helical structure, demonstrating the use of these parameters in structure determination. In general, multiple exponentials are required to fit the saturation recovery data, thus identifying multiple states of the side chain. In one case, multiple conformations detected in the spectrum are not evident in the saturation recovery, suggesting rapid exchange on the timescale of spin-lattice relaxation.},

abstract = {We present here a study on proteorhodopsin (PR) 2D crystals with analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The aim of our experiments was to test the activity of 2D crystal sample preparations and to gain further insight in PR structure, stability and function with these techniques. Our results demonstrate higher stability compared to detergent-solubilized or reconstituted samples. For different pH values, low pH 2D crystals tend to form bigger aggregates and are less stable than at basic pH. The pH 9 sample shows a sharp phase transition during heat denaturation and there is also evidence for protein-protein interaction due to the close proximity of the proteins in the 2D crystals. In the FTIR measurements at cryogenic temperatures (77 K), we characterized the first step in the PR photocycle. At pH 9, the K intermediate could be observed and the samples showed no orientation effects. At pH 5, we could trap the K/L intermediate, characterized by its negative IR signal at 1741 cm(-1). In rapid-scan FTIR experiments, we could also identify the M intermediate of the photocycle at basic pH. We conclude that the PR 2D crystals exhibit a fully functional photocycle and are therefore well suited for further studies on the proton transport mechanism of PR.},

Since this is a one-dimensional experiment, the (T(1)/T(2))T(2) ratio can be acquired, potentially, in just two scans; the second scan being a reference CPMG measurement. Conventionally, T(1)/T(2) is determined from a two-dimensional T(1)-T(2) relaxation correlation experiment. The method described here offers a significant reduction in experimental time without a reduction in signal-to-noise. The (T(1)/T(2)) ratio is useful for comparing the behaviour of liquids in porous media. Here we demonstrate the application of the DECPMG sequence to the study of oil-bearing rocks by differentiating oil or water saturated rock cores, and by observing the relative strengths of surface interaction for water in two types of rock by measuring (T(1)/T(2)) as a function of magnetic field strength.},

@article{Armstrong_jacs,
abstract = {Surface and internal water dynamics of molecules and soft matter are of great relevance to their structure and function, yet the experimental determination under ambient and steady-state conditions is challenging. One of the most powerful approaches to measure local water dynamics within 5 A distances is to utilize the modulation of the nuclear spin relaxation rate of water protons through their time-dependent dipolar coupling to paramagnetic probes, here nitroxide spin labels. We recently introduced a method to obtain local water dynamics through Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This has a unique advantage over other related techniques available in that a highly amplified proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal carries the information, allowing the use of minute microliter sample volumes and 100 muM sample concentrations. The outcome of our approach is the quantitative determination of the key DNP parameter known as the coupling factor, which provides local translational diffusion dynamics of the solvent within 5 A of the spin label. In contrast to recent reports that the coupling factor for nitroxide radicals cannot be quantified due to the difficulty in determining the saturation factor for the spin label, we show the saturation factor can be accurately determined and for the first time present agreement between measurements and theory. We discuss the discrepancy between the related field cycling relaxometery technique and DNP in determining the coupling factor and present arguments in support of the DNP-determined value. DNP measurements of local hydration dynamics around nitroxides in bulk water and on the surface of proteins are presented.},

To probe the transition state of ubiquitin thermal unfolding, we examine unfolding dynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant ubiquitin using time-resolved nonlinear infrared spectroscopy after a nanosecond temperature jump. We observe spectral changes on two different time scales. A fast nonexponential microsecond phase is attributed to downhill unfolding from the transition state region, which is induced by a shift of the barrier due to the rapid temperature change. Slow millisecond changes arise from thermally activated folding and unfolding kinetics. Mutants that stabilize or destabilize beta strands III-V lead to a decreased or increased amplitude of the microsecond phase, indicating that the disruption or weakening of these strands occurs in the transition state. Unfolding features from microseconds to milliseconds can be explained by temperature-dependent changes of a two-dimensional free energy surface constructed by the native contacts between beta strands of the protein. In addition, the results support the possibility of an intermediate state in thermal unfolding.},

From the quadrupolar splittings delta vq, the molecular order parameters S describing the motions of the sterols in the bilayer were calculated, and the most probable angle of tilt alpha 0 of the molecular axis of the sterols relative to the bilayer normal was determined. We observed that the molecular axis of cholesterol in DPPC liposomes at both 24 and 60 degrees C is tilted at an angle of 16-19 degrees with the 3 beta-hydroxyl group projecting parallel to the bilayer normal into the aqueous interface. In contrast, at 24 degrees C, epicholesterol is aligned parallel (0 degrees) to the bilayer normal, placing the 3 alpha-hydroxyl group essentially perpendicular to the bilayer normal along the aqueous interface. At 60 degrees C, the average angle of epicholesterol (16-18 degrees) is similar to that of cholesterol, which can project the 3 alpha-hydroxyl group into the hydrophobic bilayer region. On the basis of the observed tilt angles of the two isomeric sterols in DPPC liposomes, a model is proposed that can rationalize the differential effects of cholesterol and epicholesterol on membrane properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Recent optical trap experiments have applied resisting, assisting, and sideways loads to conventional kinesin moving on microtubules at fixed [ATP]. To gain insight into intermediate motions when the motor protein takes its 8.2-nm steps, the velocity and randomness data have been analyzed by using discrete-state stochastic models with a three-dimensional "energy landscape." The bead size and tether angle play a crucial role. The analysis implies that on binding ATP the motor "crouches," the point of attachment of the tether at the necklinker junction moving downward toward the microtubule by 0.5-0.7 nm, while inching forward by only 0.1-0.2 nm, before completing the step from a transition state by a unitary "sprint" of approximately 7.8 nm. These inferences accord with high-resolution observations that exclude a previously predicted substep of 1.8-2.1 nm. Assisting and leftward loads are opposed in that the perpendicular component of the tension in the tether is enhanced by approximately 2 pN, which reduces the velocity, but sideways lurching is not supported.},

abstract = {The properties of water in biological systems have been studied for well over a century by a wide range of physical techniques, but progress has been slow and erratic. Protein hydration--the perturbation of water structure and dynamics by the protein surface--has been a particularly rich source of controversy and confusion. Our aim here is to critically examine central concepts in the description of protein hydration, and to assess the experimental basis for the current view of protein hydration, with the focus on dynamic aspects. Recent oxygen-17 magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments have shown that the vast majority of water molecules in the protein hydration layer suffer a mere twofold dynamic retardation compared with bulk water. The high mobility of hydration water ensures that all thermally activated processes at the protein-water interface, such as binding, recognition and catalysis, can proceed at high rates. The MRD-derived picture of a highly mobile hydration layer is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but is incompatible with results deduced from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is also inconsistent with the common view of hydration effects on protein hydrodynamics. Here, we show how these discrepancies can be resolved.},

abstract = {A computer-aided analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of TEMPO radicals adsorbed in X zeolites is performed under various experimental conditions, both in the absence and in the presence of various species. In dehydrated NaX zeolites the radical gives rise to two superimposed signals corresponding to species characterized by different mobility and polarity and by a different temperature dependence. Controlled addition of water leads to an increase of mobility up to 4.2 water molecules per supercage. Under conditions of partial hydration, the radicals show an increase in the correlation time for motion with an increase in the size of the cation in the exchanged zeolites, whereas an increase in mobility is found upon going from NaX to NaY samples. These results are analyzed in terms of the variation of the local electric field at the surface. Dipolar broadening is shown to be responsible for the line shape variations found at TEMPO loadings up to 0.32 molecules per supercage. Heisenberg spin--spin interactions also become relevant at higher loading. Increasing amounts of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine induce a restriction of mobility. This result is interpreted in terms of a decrease in the free volume available to radicals which occupy the zeolite cavities. However, loading of pentane leads to a similar increase in mobility as found with increasing amounts of water. The environmental polarity, as expected, decreases due to the replacement of water molecules with pentane. It is proposed that the zeolite hosts, when saturated with pentane, slow moving radicals which are trapped in the pores.},

abstract = {Spin-dynamics of the spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) P(700)(+)A(1A)(-) in the photosystem I (PSI) reaction center protein have been investigated with high-frequency (HF), time-resolved EPR spectroscopy. The superior spectral resolution of HF EPR enables spin-dynamics for both the donor and acceptor radicals in the pair to be monitored independently. Decay constants of each spin were measured as a function of temperature and compared to data obtained at X-band EPR. Relaxation times, T(1), and decay rates, k(S), are the same at both X- and D-band magnetic fields. The spin-dynamics within the radical pair were determined from theoretical simulation of experimental time-resolved HF EPR spectra. At low temperatures, T < 60 K, the decay of the SCRP from the singlet state, k(S), is the predominant process, while at high temperatures, T > 130 K, the T(1) relaxation is much faster than k(S). The recombination rate k(S) was observed to decrease as the temperature is increased. These EPR spectral results are in agreement with previously reported optical measurements of P(700)(+)A(1)(-) radical pair recombination.},

We probed the accessibility of these residues by (19)F-MAS NMR. For this purpose, an efficient but simple protocol for chemical fluorine labeling of accessible cysteines in membrane proteins was established. This one-step reaction was applied to detergent-solubilized PR before reconstitution into phospholipids. All three cysteines could be labeled and showed distinct (19)F chemical shifts with different integral intensities. The accessibility of these cysteines is discussed in the context of a homology model. With the chemical cysteine labeling procedure shown here, an attractive option for site-directed solid-state NMR studies on other membrane proteins is offered due to the high intrinsic sensitivity of (19)F-MAS NMR.},

The reaction performed with a unitary GM1 derivative/mixed anhydride molar ratio, occurs with a yield of above 40\%. The labelled deacetylated GM1 molecular species are then N-acetylated by means of acetic anhydride with quantitative yield. The chemical process of insertion of labelled fatty acid and reconstitution of GM1 ganglioside has been confirmed by GLC-MS and NMR analyses. Fluorescence and electron spin resonance experiments indicate that the labelled gangliosides behave similarly to natural GM1, in both the aggregation properties and the capability to be transferred from micelles to vesicular dispersions of phospholipids.

At 250 MHz T, is shorter than at X-band and more strongly dependent on viscosity. The enhanced relaxation at 250 MHz is attributed to modulation of electron-proton dipolar coupling by tumbling of the trityl radicals at rates that are comparable to the reciprocal of the resonance frequency. Deuteration of the solvent was used to distinguish relaxation due to solvent protons from the relaxation due to intra-molecular electron-proton interactions at 250 MHz. For trityl-CD3, which contains no protons, modulation of dipolar interaction with solvent protons dominates T-1. For proton-containing radicals the relative importance of modulation of intra- and inter-molecular proton interactions varies with solution viscosity. The viscosity and frequency dependence of T-1 was modeled based on dipolar interaction with a defined number of protons at specified distances from the unpaired electron. At each of the frequencies examined T-2 decreases with increasing viscosity consistent with contributions from T-1 and from incomplete motional averaging of anisotropic hyperfine interaction.

abstract = {A new approach has been developed to probe the structural properties of membrane peptides and proteins using the pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance technique of electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy and the $\alpha$-helical M2$\delta$ subunit of the acetylcholine receptor incorporated into phospholipid bicelles. To demonstrate the practicality of this method, a cysteine-mutated nitroxide spin label (SL) is positioned 1, 2, 3, and 4 residues away from a fully deuterated Val side chain (denoted i + 1 to i + 4). The characteristic periodicity of the $\alpha$-helical structure gives rise to a unique pattern in the ESEEM spectra. In the i + 1 and i + 2 samples, the ²H nuclei are too far away to be detected. However, with the 3.6 residue per turn pattern of an $\alpha$-helix, the i + 3 and i + 4 samples reveal a strong signal from the ²H nuclei of the Val side chain. Modeling studies verify these data suggesting that the closest ²H-labeled Val to SL distance would in fact be expected in the i + 3 and i + 4 samples. This technique is very advantageous, because it provides pertinent qualitative structural information on an inherently difficult system like membrane proteins in a short period of time (minutes) with small amounts of protein ($\mu$g).},

abstract = {We describe the first study comparing the ability of phase shift velocity imaging and Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced imaging to generate contrast for visualizing the flow of water. Prepolarization of water by the Overhauser DNP mechanism is performed in the 0.35T fringe field of an unshielded 2.0T non-clinical MRI magnet, followed by the rapid transfer of polarization-enhanced water to the 2.0T imaging location. This technique, previously named remotely enhanced liquids for image contrast (RELIC), produces a continuous flow of hyperpolarized water and gives up to an -8.2-fold enhanced signal within the image with respect to thermally polarized signal at 2.0T. Using flow through a cylindrical expansion phantom as a model system, spin-echo intensity images with DNP are compared to 3D phase shift velocity images to illustrate the complementary information available from the two techniques. The spin-echo intensity images enhanced with DNP show that the levels of enhancement provide an estimate of the transient propagation of flow, while the phase shift velocity images quantitatively measure the velocity of each imaging voxel. Phase shift velocity images acquired with and without DNP show that DNP weights velocity values towards those of the inflowing (DNP-enhanced) water, while velocity images without DNP more accurately reflect the average steady-state velocity of each voxel. We conclude that imaging with DNP prepolarized water better captures the transient path of water shortly after injection, while phase shift velocity imaging is best for quantifying the steady-state flow of water throughout the entire phantom.},

abstract = {The structure of dodecylamine (DDA) aggregates acting as templates in the synthesis of mesoporous silica (in the DDA/water/ethanol/TEOS system) was studied via EPR spectra of a variety of spin probes and of a spin-labeled silica precursor. Two recipes have been examd.: one, starting from a water-rich DDA soln., A0, reported to produce a silica with framework mesopores and textural pores comparable in vol., and another, starting from an ethanol-rich soln., B0, which yields a solid having practically only framework pores. For both compns. the relative positions of the spin probes in the aggregates have been detd., the local polarities expressed in terms of the Kosower scale and their motions examd. The aggregates formed have been characterized as emulsion droplets for A0 and micelles with radii <25 .ANG. for B0. After reaction of A0 and B0 with TEOS, all probes showed significantly hindered motion in the wet ppts. In the solid B, pptd. from the ethanol-rich solvent, the spin probes 5- and 7-doxyl stearic acid (5- and 7-DSA) are strongly immobilized, while other probes maintain quasi-isotropic motion but with very large rotational correlation times. This pattern is characteristic of micelles with hindered tumbling and/or lateral diffusion and is assigned to those aggregates (in interaction with the silica component) on which the framework mesopores are formed. In solid A, pptd. from A0, 5- and 7-DSA spin probes maintain the spectra with anisotropic features, characterized by an order degree found in the starting emulsion, but with evidence of tighter packing, while other probes have their rotation retarded. These aggregates have a low curvature interface, characteristic of emulsion droplets and are assumed to be at the origin of the large textural pores, which characterize this solid. Adsorption of probes after synthesis rather than before pptn. supports these assignments. We have also found that the surfactant-silica interaction is critically dependent on solvent. The strong immobilization of the probes in the interface region, obsd. during drying at low temps., is a reversible process, since under these conditions the silica network crosslinking is only incipient; 29Si NMR data show that crosslinking becomes important only at >90 DegC.

abstract = {The spin dynamics for Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill-like sequences is analyzed in grossly inhomogeneous B(0) and B(1) fields. This problem is important for many applications, especially when the bandwidth of the signal is excitation limited. Examples include stray-field NMR or inside-out NMR probes used in well logging. The amplitudes of the first few echoes exhibit a characteristic transient behavior but quickly approach a smooth asymptotic behavior. For simple Hamiltonians without scalar or dipolar couplings, the evolution of a refocusing subcycle for a given isochromat is described by a rotation. Simple expressions for the signal of the Nth echo are derived in terms of these effective rotations that have a simple geometrical interpretation. It is shown that the asymptotic behavior is controlled by the direction of the axis of these effective rotations and the signal is dominated by magnetization "spin-locked" to the rotation axis. The phase of the signal is independent of the details of the field inhomogeneities. Relaxation in inhomogeneous fields leads to a signal decay that is in general nonexponential with an initial decay rate that is a weighted sum of T(-1)(1) and T(-1)(2). At long times, the echo amplitudes decay to a finite value. Phase cycling eliminates this offset. The effect of diffusion is also studied. This analysis has been applied to an inside-out NMR well logging apparatus. Good quantitative agreement is found between measurements and calculations that are based on the measured B(0) and B(1) field maps.},

abstract = {Many cellular processes require the generation of highly curved regions of cell membranes by interfacial membrane proteins. A number of such proteins are now known, and several mechanisms of curvature generation have been suggested, but so far a quantitative understanding of the importance of the various potential mechanisms remains elusive. Following previous theoretical work, we consider the electrostatic attraction that underlies the scaffold mechanism of membrane bending in the context of the N-BAR domain of amphiphysin. Analysis of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveals considerable water between the membrane and the positively charged concave face of the BAR, even when it is tightly bound to highly curved membranes. This results in significant screening of electrostatic interactions, suggesting that electrostatic attraction is not the main driving force behind curvature sensing, supporting recent experimental work. These results also emphasize the need for care when building coarse-grained models of protein-membrane interactions. These results are emphasized by simulations of oligomerized amphiphysin N-BARs at the atomistic and coarse-grained level. In the coarse-grained simulations, we find a strong dependence of the induced curvature on the dielectric screening.},

In accord with earlier expectations, we find that fluctuations of the liquid-vapor-like interface surrounding the solutes are significant, in this case leading to the formation of a vapor tunnel between the two solute particles. This tunnel accelerates assembly. While considering this specific model system, the approach we use illustrates a methodology that is broadly applicable.},

abstract = {Nitroxide spin probes have been widely used to study the behavior of surfactants in soln. as well at solid-liq. interfaces. In this study the effect of temp. on the mobility of nitroxide spin probes in cyclohexane and at the alumina/cyclohexane interface is investigated in the presence of anionic aerosol-OT (AOT). The probe mobility in AOT micelles in soln. is markedly dependent on the amt. of solubilized water. The variation with temp. of the mobilities of adsorbed doxyl stearic acid with the nitroxide probe at the 5th, 10th, and 16th positions from the -COOH group has shed some light on the mechanisms of interaction of the probe with the solid surface as well as the mol. structure of the adsorbed layer. The results indicate that the adsorption of the probe occurs mainly through interactions of the -COOH group with the surface while the -NO group interacts only weakly with the surface. The adsorption of AOT causes changes in probe mobility with the changes being most significant when the nitroxide group on the stearic acid chain is farthest from the anchoring group. It is suggested that the adsorption of the surfactant causes an orientational rearrangement of the probe mols. The relatively low-temp. effect on the probe mobility obsd. in the presence of surfactant is attributed to the compactness of the adsorbed layer which is found to be stable even at elevated temps.

abstract = {The mechanism and the rate of hydrogen bond-breaking in the hydration layer surrounding an aqueous protein are important ingredients required to understand the various aspects of protein dynamics, its function, and stability. Here, we use computer simulation and a time correlation function technique to understand these aspects in the hydration layer of lysozyme. Water molecules in the layer are found to exhibit three distinct bond-breaking mechanisms. A large angle orientational jump of the donor water molecule is common among all of them. In the most common ( approximately 80\%) bond-breaking event in the layer, the new acceptor water molecule comes from the first coordination shell (initially within 3.5 A of the donor), and the old acceptor water molecule remains within the first coordination shell, even after the bond-breaking. This is in contrast to that in bulk water, in which both of the acceptor molecules involve the second coordination shell. Additionally, the motion of the incoming and the outgoing acceptor molecules involved is not diffusive in the hydration layer, in contrast to their observed diffusive motion in the bulk. The difference in rotational dynamics between the bulk and the hydration layer water molecules is clearly manifested in the calculated time-dependent angular van Hove self-correlation function ( G(theta, t)) which has a pronounced two-peak structure in the layer, and this can be traced to the constrained translational motion in the layer. The longevity of the surrounding hydrogen bond network is found to be significantly enhanced near a hydrophilic residue.},

abstract = {Amphiphilic moieties such as lysophosphoglycerides and long-chain acyl carnitines accumulate in ischemic myocardium and potentially contribute to the sequelae of myocardial ischemia. To characterize alterations in membrane mol. dynamics produced by amphiphilic compds., highly purified prepns. of canine myocardial sarcolemma were spin-labeled with paramagnetic probes (5-, 12, or 16-doxyl stearate), and alterations produced by amphiphilic compds. were quantified by ESR spectroscopy. Incorporation of 1.5, 3, or 6 mol\% palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in a decrease of the order parameter of 16-doxyl stearate from 0.164 to 0.161, 0.155, and 0.145, resp. Similar increases in membrane fluidity in the interior of the bilayer were present when palmitoyl lyosphosphatidylethanolamine, L-palmitoyl carnitine, and platelet-activating factor were incorporated into sarcolemma. In contrast, incubation of sarcolemma with lysophosphatidylcholine did not result in significant change of the order parameter of 5-doxyl stearate, even at 6 mol\%, demonstrating that lysophosphatidylcholine increases the transmembrane fluidity gradient. Sarcolemma treated with phospholipase A2 exhibited a time-dependent decrease in the rotational correlation time and order parameter when lysophospholipids constituted a small amt. (6\%) of sarcolemmal phospholipids. Furthermore, the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine were not dependent upon its phys. state, since bilayers composed of gramicidin and lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in similar increases in membrane fluidity as micellar lysophosphatidylcholine. The results suggest that alterations in sarcolemmal mol. dynamics are one mechanism through which amphiphilic moieties mediate their multiple effects. Such alterations could contribute to the electrophysiol. and biochem. sequelae of myocardial ischemia. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Wastewater was fed directly onto the cathode which was horizontally installed in the upper part of the MFC. Oxygen could be utilized readily from the air. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the influent wastewater had little effect on the power generation. A saturation-type relationship was observed between the initial COD and the power generation. The influent flow rate could affect greatly the power density. Fed by the synthetic glucose wastewater with a COD value of 3500mg/L at a flow rate of 4.0mL/min, the developed MFC could produce a maximum power density of 37.4mW/m(2). Its applicability was further evaluated by the treatment of brewery wastewater. The system could be scaled up readily due to its simple configuration, easy operation and relatively high power density.},

abstract = {The condensation of bacteriophage phi29 genomic DNA into its preformed procapsid requires the DNA packaging motor, which is the strongest known biological motor. The packaging motor is an intricate ring-shaped protein/RNA complex, and its function requires an RNA component called packaging RNA (pRNA). Current structural information on pRNA is limited, which hinders studies of motor function. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling to map the conformation of a pRNA three-way junction that bridges binding sites for the motor ATPase and the procapsid. The studies were carried out on a pRNA dimer, which is the simplest ring-shaped pRNA complex and serves as a functional intermediate during motor assembly. Using a nucleotide-independent labeling scheme, stable nitroxide radicals were attached to eight specific pRNA sites without perturbing RNA folding and dimer formation, and a total of 17 internitroxide distances spanning the three-way junction were measured using Double Electron-Electron Resonance spectroscopy. The measured distances, together with steric chemical constraints, were used to select 3662 viable three-way junction models from a pool of 65 billion. The results reveal a similar conformation among the viable models, with two of the helices (H(T) and H(L)) adopting an acute bend. This is in contrast to a recently reported pRNA tetramer crystal structure, in which H(T) and H(L) stack onto each other linearly. The studies establish a new method for mapping global structures of complex RNA molecules, and provide information on pRNA conformation that aids investigations of phi29 packaging motor and developments of pRNA-based nanomedicine and nanomaterial.},

abstract = {A survey is made of different ways in which nuclear spins can relax through their interaction with electronic spins. It is shown that the maximum amount of nuclear polarization which can be obtained by saturating the electronic resonance depends: (a) on the type of interaction between electronic and nuclear spins, namely dipole-dipole type, scalar product type, or any combination of the two; (b) on the mechanism whereby the "lattice" provides the energy for the relaxation.
The case of a nucleus belonging to a paramagnetic ion is examined in some detail with reference to the recent experiment of Honig on arsenic-doped silicon. It is shown that while an Overhauser effect may be expected, this offers no support for an interpretation of Honig's results as a hundred percent nuclear polarization.},

Digital down-conversion produced baseband signals in quadrature with very precise orthogonality. Real-time resonator tuning was performed by monitoring the Fourier transforms of signals reflected from the resonator during frequency sweeps generated by the AWG. The capabilities of the system were demonstrated by rapid magnetic field scans at 256 MHz carrier frequency, and FID and spin echo experiments at 1 and 10 GHz carrier frequencies. For the rapid scan experiments the leakage through a cross-loop resonator was compensated by adjusting the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid at the carrier frequency that was generated with another AWG channel.},

Consequently, a great deal of attention has been focused on changes in the relaxation dynamics of water when it is located at the protein surface. Here we use the ultrafast optical Kerr effect to study the H-bond structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions of proteins. Measurements are made for three proteins as a function of concentration. We find that the water dynamics in the first solvation layer of the proteins are slowed by up to a factor of 8 in comparison to those in bulk water. The most marked slowdown was observed for the most hydrophilic protein studied, bovine serum albumin, whereas the most hydrophobic protein, trypsin, had a slightly smaller effect. The terahertz Raman spectra of these protein solutions resemble those of pure water up to 5 wt \% of protein, above which a new feature appears at \~{}80 cm(-1), which is assigned to a bending of the protein amide chain.},

abstract = {Recently a triarylmethyl-based (TAM) radical has been developed for research in biological and other aqueous systems, and in low magnetic fields, 10 mT or less, large H-1 dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancements have been reported. In this paper the DNP properties of this radical have been investigated in a considerably larger field of 1.4 T, corresponding to proton and electron Larmor frequencies of 60 MHz and 40 GHz, respectively. To avoid excessive microwave heating of the sample, an existing DNP NMR probe was modified with a screening coil, wound around the sample capillary and with its axis perpendicular to the electric component of the microwave field. It was found that with this probe the temperature increase in the sample after 4 s of microwave irradiation with an incident power of 10 W was only 16 degrees C. For the investigations, 10 mM of the TAM radical was dissolved in deionized, but not degassed, water and put into a l-mm i.d. and 6-mm long capillary tube. At 26 degrees C the following results were obtained: (I) The relaxivity of the radical is 0.07 (mMs)(-1), in accordance with the value extrapolated from low-field results; (II) The leakage factor is 0.63, the saturation factor at maximum power is 0.85, and the coupling factor is -0.0187. It is shown that these results agree very well with an analysis where the electron-dipolar interactions are the dominant DNP mechanism, and where the relaxation transitions resulting from these interactions are governed by translational diffusion of the water molecules. Finally, the possibilities of combining DNP with magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) are discussed. It is shown that at 26 degrees C the overall DNP-enhanced proton polarization should become maximal in an external field of 0.3 T and become comparable to the thermal equilibrium polarization in a field of 30 T, considerably larger than the largest high-resolution magnet available to date. It is concluded that DNP MRM in this field, which corresponds to a standard microwave frequency of 9 GHz, has the potential to significantly increase the sensitivity in NMR and MRI experiments of small aqueous samples doped with the TAM radical.

abstract = {Hydration of oxidized rubredoxin (Fe(III)(S-Cys)(4) center) was investigated by (1)H and (17)O relaxation measurements of bulk water as a function of the applied magnetic field (nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion). Oxidized rubredoxin showed an increased water (1)H relaxation profile with respect to the diamagnetic gallium derivative or reduced species. Analysis of the data shows evidence of exchangeable proton(s) approximately 4.0-4.5 A from the metal ion, the exchange time being longer than 10(-10) s and shorter than 10(-5) s. The correlation time for the proton-electrons interaction is 7 x 10(-11) s and is attributed to the effective electron relaxation time. Its magnitude is consistent with the large signal linewidths of the protein donor nuclei, observed in high resolution NMR spectra. For reduced rubredoxin, such correlation time is proposed to be smaller than 10(-11) s. (17)O relaxation measurements suggest the presence of at least one long-lived protein-bound water molecule. Analogous relaxation measurements were performed on the C6S rubredoxin variant, whose iron(III) center has been previously shown to be coordinated to three cysteine residues and a hydroxide ion above pH 6. (1)H nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles indicate increased hydration with respect to the wild-type.},

abstract = {An efficient noninvasive method for in vivo imaging of tumor oxygenation by using a low-field magnetic resonance scanner and a paramagnetic contrast agent is described. The methodology is based on Overhauser enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (OMRI), a functional imaging technique. OMRI experiments were performed on tumor-bearing mice (squamous cell carcinoma) by i.v. administration of the contrast agent Oxo63 (a highly derivatized triarylmethyl radical) at nontoxic doses in the range of 2-7 mmol/kg either as a bolus or as a continuous infusion. Spatially resolved pO2 (oxygen concentration) images from OMRI experiments of tumor-bearing mice exhibited heterogeneous oxygenation profiles and revealed regions of hypoxia in tumors (<10 mmHg; 1 mmHg = 133 Pa). Oxygenation of tumors was enhanced on carbogen (95\% O2/5\% CO2) inhalation. The pO2 measurements from OMRI were found to be in agreement with those obtained by independent polarographic measurements using a pO2 Eppendorf electrode. This work illustrates that anatomically coregistered pO2 maps of tumors can be readily obtained by combining the good anatomical resolution of water proton-based MRI, and the superior pO2 sensitivity of EPR. OMRI affords the opportunity to perform noninvasive and repeated pO2 measurements of the same animal with useful spatial ([approx]1 mm) and temporal (2 min) resolution, making this method a powerful imaging modality for small animal research to understand tumor physiology and potentially for human applications.},

Like in NMR, it is possible to use lumped elements; coils can confine the microwave field to volumes that are much smaller than the wavelength. We discuss the design and evaluation of EPR resonators on the basis of planar microcoils. Our test resonators, which operate at a frequency of 14 GHz, have excellent microwave efficiency factors, achieving 24 ns pi/2 EPR pulses with an input power of 17 mW.

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy provides a variety of tools to study structures and structural changes of large biomolecules or complexes thereof. In order to unravel secondary structure elements, domain arrangements or complex formation, continuous wave and pulsed EPR methods capable of measuring the magnetic dipole coupling between two unpaired electrons can be used to obtain long-range distance constraints on the nanometer scale. Such methods yield reliably and precisely distances of up to 80 A, can be applied to biomolecules in aqueous buffer solutions or membranes, and are not size limited. They can be applied either at cryogenic or physiological temperatures and down to amounts of a few nanomoles. Spin centers may be metal ions, metal clusters, cofactor radicals, amino acid radicals, or spin labels. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different EPR spectroscopic methods, briefly describe their theoretical background, and summarize important biological applications. The main focus of this article will be on pulsed EPR methods like pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) and their applications to spin-labeled biosystems.},

Basic properties such as characteristic impedance and electromagnetic field distribution are examined for various coil designs by means of experiment and simulation. The combined setup operates relevantly in the experiment at dilution temperature. The frequency responses of the return loss and Coulomb blockade current are examined. Capacitive coupling between a coil and a quantum dot causes photon assisted tunneling, whose signal can greatly overlap the electron spin resonance signal. To suppress the photon assisted tunneling effect, a technique for compensating for the microwave electric field is developed. Good performance of this technique is confirmed from measurement of Coulomb blockade oscillations.},

abstract = {In site-directed spin labeling, a covalently attached nitroxide probe containing a chemically inert unpaired electron is utilized to obtain information on the local environment of the parent macromolecule. Studies presented here examine the feasibility of probing local DNA structural and dynamic features using a class of nitroxide probes that are linked to chemically substituted phosphorothioate positions at the DNA backbone. Two members of this family, designated as R5 and R5a, were attached to eight different sites of a dodecameric DNA duplex without severely perturbing the native B-form conformation. Measured X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, which report on nitroxide rotational motions, were found to vary depending on the location of the label (e.g., duplex center vs termini) and the surrounding DNA sequence. This indicates that R5 and R5a can provide information on the DNA local environment at the level of an individual nucleotide. As these probes can be attached to arbitrary nucleotides within a nucleic acid sequence, they may provide a means to "scan" a given DNA molecule in order to interrogate its local structural and dynamic features.},

abstract = {The molecular motion of the phenalenyl (PNL) spin probe in the supercages of cation-exchanged X and Y zeolites (faujasites) has been physically characterized by pulsed and continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Both X and Y zeolites, whose cation sites were exchanged with the alkali metal ions, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ were examined. There is a good correspondence between the temperature dependences of the PNL electron spin phase memory time and the CW EPR spectra. Both display evidence of a thermal activation from a stationary, non-rotating molecular state to a low-temperature state of in-plane rotation (Das et al., Chem Phys. 143 (1990) 253). The rate of in-plane rotation is an activated process, with E*| / R=1289 |+- 35 K and 1462 +/- 47 K in NaX and KX zeolites, respectively. The rotation appears to be about an axis along which the half-filled, non-bonding [pi] orbital interacts with the exchanged cation in the supercage. Both CW and pulsed EPR also show a higher temperature activation from the in-plane rotating state to an effectively isoptropic state of rotation of PNL in which the PNL-cation bond is thought to be broken, with E*[perpendicular] / R=2050 +/- 110 K, 1956 +/- 46K, 1335 +/- 97 K in LiX, NaX and KX zeolites, respectively. The strength of the PNL-cation bonding decreases with increasing cation atomic number as indicated by E*[perpendicular] and the peripheral repulsion (crowding) of PNL increases with cation size as indicated E*|. There are qualitative indications that the binding of PNL to the cations in the Y zeolite is stronger than in the X zeolite.},

The DOTA ring exhibits several isomers that are in exchange; however, single resonances were observed for most amide groups in the protein, allowing determination of a single, apparent magnetic-susceptibility tensor. Pseudocontact shifts caused by Yb-containing CLaNP-3 were observed for atoms at 15-35 A from the metal. By using Gd-containing CLaNP-3, relaxation effects were observed, allowing distances up to 30 A from the paramagnetic center to be determined accurately. Similar results were obtained with a Gd-DTPA (diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid) chelate, CLaNP-1, bound in the same bidentate manner to the protein. This study demonstrates that bidentate attachment of a paramagnetic probe enables determination of long-range distances.},

abstract = {Degradation of proteins is important for the operating life of biocatalysts and the shelf life of protein pharmaceuticals. We have previously found that the deactivating effects of salts on proteins can be correlated to an indicator of ion hydration, the B-viscosity coefficient of the anion in solution. Here, we test the influence of cations on protein kinetic stability by observing deactivation of mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) in ammonium, caesium and chloride salt solutions, and we find that mRFP deactivation does not depend on cation hydration. We also measure mRFP deactivation in solutions containing denaturants (guanidinium chloride or urea) or stabilizing co-solutes (glycerol or sucrose) frequently encountered in many protein formulations to test whether hydration of these co-solutes can be used to indicate their relative effects on protein kinetic stability. We find that mRFP deactivation in solutions containing kosmotropic salts or stabilizers reaches a limiting rate and that hydration of denaturants is not an indicator of their denaturing strength.},

L64/water/o-xylene and in the binary mixt. L64/water, using ESR spectroscopy with nitroxide spin probes. The spin probes differed in size, structure, and polarity and belong to two main types: (a) cationic probes 4-(N,N-dimethyl-N-alkylammonio)-2,2',6,6'-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl iodide (CATn) with n, the no. of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent, equal to 1, 4, 8, 11, and 16; (b) amphiphilic probes based on x-doxylstearic acid (xDSA) with x, the carbon atom to which the doxyl group is attached, equal to 5, 7, 10, and 16. X-band ESR spectra reflect the intercalation of the probes in the self-assembled L64 system, but different probes choose different locations in the aggregates and report on the local polarity, hydration, and degree of order. The hydration gradient in the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) core of the reverse micelles was estd. on a scale of ?48 .ANG. from the anal. of aN, the isotropic hyperfine splitting of 14N, in the CATn series by comparison with a $\backslash$"calibration curve$\backslash$" based on CAT4 in aq. solns. of PEO. The lower homologs in the series (n = 1 and 4) are located near the center of the hydrated core, while the higher homologs (n = 11 and 16) are close to the interface between the hydrated core and the o-xylene-swollen poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) blocks. The xDSA probes have their head group near the interface between the core and the PPO regions. The nitroxide group in 5DSA is at the core/PPO interface, but the nitroxide groups in the other doxyl probes are at different depths in the PPO regions, depending on the value of x. The dynamics of the CATn probes was elucidated by comparing the exptl. B and C parameters in the expression for the line width in motionally averaged ESR spectra of nitroxides DH(mI) = A + BmI + CmI2, with the corresponding values calcd. as a function of the direction of the axis of rotation and N, the degree of anisotropy of the rotational reorientation. The comparison suggests that the dominant motional mechanism for all probes is rotation around the N-O bond (x axis), but the anisotropy of the lower spin probe homologs is significantly higher (N = 10) compared to that of the higher homologs (N = 2-3). These results are consistent with the existence of a hydration gradient in the core of the reverse micelles. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {In a previous communication [Hu , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 10844 (2004)], an approach was demonstrated that improves the efficiency of the cross-effect polarization mechanism employed in high field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments. Specifically, it was shown that tethering two TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) radicals increases the electron-electron dipole coupling from similar to 1 MHz in solutions of monomeric TEMPO to similar to 25 MHz in a tethered biradical. The larger coupling resulted in an increase in the DNP enhancements by a factor of similar to 3-4, from 45-50 to similar to 165. Here, a second approach to improving the efficiency of the polarization process is described that involves approximately satisfying the matching condition parallel to omega(2e)-omega(1e)parallel to=omega(n), where omega(2e) and omega(1e) are two frequencies in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and omega(n) is the Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins being polarized. Specifically, in a mixture of TEMPO and trityl [tris (8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl(-d3)-benzo[1,2d:4,5-d']bis(1,3)dithiol-4-yl) methyl] radicals, the intensity maxima in the EPR spectra of these two species are approximately separated by the H-1 NMR frequency. In this case the frequency difference between the g(yy) value of TEMPO and the narrow pseudo-isotropic g-value of trityl is similar to 224 MHz and the H-1 Larmor frequency is 211 MHz. The optimal magnetic field for DNP using the mixtures was found to coincide with the trityl EPR resonance. At 90 K and 5 T, a mixture of 20 mM TEMPO and 20 mM trityl enhanced the H-1 polarization by a factor of similar to 160, an improvement over the enhancement of similar to 50 with 40 mM TEMPO. The reasons for the improvement are discussed and evidence is presented suggesting that DNP enhancement can be improved further by tethering TEMPO and trityl or two similar radicals.

abstract = {A new pulse sequence for rapid imaging of free radicals is presented which combines snapshot imaging methods and conventional field-cycled proton electron double resonance imaging (FC-PEDRI). The new sequence allows the no. of EPR irradn. periods to be optimized to obtain an acceptable SNR and spatial resoln. of free radical distribution in the final image while reducing the RF power deposition and increasing the temporal resoln. Centric reordered phase encoding has been employed to counter the problem of rapid decay of the Overhauser-enhanced signal. A phase-correction scheme has also been used to correct problems arising from instability of the magnetic field following field-cycling. In vivo expts. were carried out using triaryl Me free radical contrast agent, injected at a dose of 0.214 mmol kg-1 body wt. in anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Transaxial images through the abdomen were collected using 1, 2, 4 and 8 EPR irradn. periods. Using 4 EPR irradn. periods it was possible to generate free radical distributions of acceptable SNR and resoln. The EPR power deposition is reduced by a factor of 16 and the acquisition time is reduced by a factor of 4 compared to an acquisition using the conventional FC-PEDRI pulse sequence.

abstract = {We demonstrate that adiabatic and fast passage ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses can achieve inversion over several hundreds of MHz and thus enhance the measurement sensitivity, as shown by two selected experiments. Technically, frequency-swept pulses are generated by a 12 GS/s arbitrary waveform generator and upconverted to X-band frequencies. This pulsed UWB source is utilized as an incoherent channel in an ordinary pulsed EPR spectrometer. We discuss experimental methodologies and modeling techniques to account for the response of the resonator, which can strongly limit the excitation bandwidth of the entire non-linear excitation chain. Aided by these procedures, pulses compensated for bandwidth or variations in group delay reveal enhanced inversion efficiency. The degree of bandwidth compensation is shown to depend critically on the time available for excitation. As a result, we demonstrate optimized inversion recovery and double electron electron resonance (DEER) experiments. First, virtually complete inversion of the nitroxide spectrum with an adiabatic pulse of 128ns length is achieved. Consequently, spectral diffusion between inverted and non-inverted spins is largely suppressed and the observation bandwidth can be increased to increase measurement sensitivity. Second, DEER is performed on a terpyridine-based copper (II) complex with a nitroxide-copper distance of 2.5nm. As previously demonstrated on this complex, when pumping copper spins and observing nitroxide spins, the modulation depth is severely limited by the excitation bandwidth of the pump pulse. By using fast passage UWB pulses with a maximum length of 64ns, we achieve up to threefold enhancement of the modulation depth. Associated artifacts in distance distributions when increasing the bandwidth of the pump pulse are shown to be small.},

abstract = {The major yeast phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein Sec14p is the founding member of a large eukaryotic protein superfamily. Functional analyses indicate Sec14p integrates phospholipid metabolism with the membrane trafficking activity of yeast Golgi membranes. In this regard, the ability of Sec14p to rapidly exchange bound phospholipid with phospholipid monomers that reside in stable membrane bilayers is considered to be important for Sec14p function in cells. How Sec14p-like proteins bind phospholipids remains unclear. Herein, we describe the application of EPR spectroscopy to probe the local dynamics and the electrostatic microenvironment of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) bound by Sec14p in a soluble protein-PtdCho complex. We demonstrate that PtdCho movement within the Sec14p binding pocket is both anisotropic and highly restricted and that the C-5 region of the sn-2 acyl chain of bound PtdCho is highly shielded from solvent, whereas the distal region of that same acyl chain is more accessible. Finally, high field EPR reports on a heterogeneous polarity profile experienced by a phospholipid bound to Sec14p. Taken together, the data suggest a headgroup-out orientation of Sec14p-bound PtdCho. The data further suggest that the Sec14p phospholipid binding pocket provides a polarity gradient that we propose is a primary thermodynamic factor that powers the ability of Sec14p to abstract a phospholipid from a membrane bilayer.},

abstract = {A simple strategy to separate overlapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals in biological systems is presented. Pulsed EPR methods (inversion- and saturation-recovery) allow the determination of the T(1) spin-lattice relaxation times of paramagnetic centers. T(1) may vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the species under investigation. These variations can be employed to study selectively individual species from a spectrum that results from an overlap of two species using an inversion-recovery filtered (IRf) pulsed EPR technique. The feasibility of such an IRf field-swept technique is demonstrated on model compounds (alpha,gamma-bisphenylene-beta-phenylallyl-benzolate, BDPA, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl, TEMPO) and a simple strategy for the successful analysis of such mixtures is presented. Complex I is a multisubunit membrane protein of the respiratory chain containing several iron-sulfur (FeS) centers, which are observable with EPR spectroscopy. It is not possible to investigate the functionally important FeS cluster N2 separately because this EPR signal always overlaps with the other FeS signals. This cluster can be studied selectively using the IRf field-swept technique and its EPR spectrum is in excellent agreement with previous cw-EPR data from the literature. In addition, the possibility to separate the hyperfine spectra of two spectrally overlapping paramagnetic species is demonstrated by applying this relaxation filter together with hyperfine spectroscopy (REFINE). For the first time, the application of this filter to a three-pulse electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) pulse sequence is demonstrated to selectively observe hyperfine spectra on a system containing two paramagnetic species. Finally, REFINE is used to assign the observed nitrogen modulation in complex I to an individual iron-sulfur cluster.},

abstract = {Diffusion in porous media is a general subject that involves many fields of research, such as chemistry (e.g. porous catalytic pallets), biology (e.g. porous cellular organelles), and materials science (e.g. porous polymer matrixes for controlled-release and gas-storage materials). Pulsed-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) is a powerful technique that is often employed to characterize complex diffusion patterns inside porous media. Typically it measures the motion of at least approximately 10(15) molecules occurring in the milliseconds-to-seconds time scale, which can be used to characterize diffusion in porous media with features of approximately 2-3 mum and above (in common aqueous environments). Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), which operates in the nanoseconds-to-microseconds time scale with much better spin sensitivity, can in principle be employed to measure complex diffusion patterns in porous media with much finer features (down to approximately 10 nm). However, up to now, severe technical constraints precluded the adaptation of PGSE ESR to porous media research. In this work we demonstrate for the first time the use of PGSE ESR in the characterization of molecular restricted diffusion in common liquid solutions embedded in a model system for porous media made of sub-micron glass spheres. A unique ESR resonator, efficient gradient coils and fast gradient current drivers enable these measurements. This work can be further extended in the future to many applications that involve dynamical processes occurring in porous media with features in the deep sub-micron range down to true nanometric length scales.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases are increasingly being realized to have common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation. The aggregates usually consist,of fibers containing misfolded protein with a beta-sheet conformation, termed amyloid. There is partial but not perfect overlap among the cells in which abnormal proteins are deposited and the cells that degenerate. The most likely explanation is that inclusions and other visible protein aggregates represent an end stage of a molecular cascade of several steps, and that earlier steps in the cascade may be more directly tied to pathogenesis than the inclusions themselves. For several diseases, genetic variants assist in explaining the pathogenesis of the more common sporadic forms and developing mouse and other models. There is now increased understanding of the pathways involved in protein aggregation, and some recent clues have emerged as to the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity. These are leading to approaches toward rational therapeutics.},

abstract = {Marked hydration changes occur during the self-assembly of the melittin protein tetramer in water. Hydrophobicity induces a drying transition in the gap between simple sufficiently large ( more than 1 nm(2)) strongly hydrophobic surfaces as they approach each other(1-6), resulting in the subsequent collapse of the system, as well as a depletion of water next to single surfaces(7-10). Here we investigate whether the hydrophobic induced collapse of multidomain proteins or the formation of protein oligimers exhibits a similar drying transition. We performed computer simulations to study the collapse of the tetramer of melittin in water, and observed a marked water drying transition inside a nanoscale channel of the tetramer ( with a channel size of up to two or three water-molecule diameters). This transition, although occurring on a microscopic length scale, is analogous to a first-order phase transition from liquid to vapour. We find that this drying is very sensitive to single mutations of the three isoleucines to less hydrophobic residues and that such mutations in the right locations can switch the channel from being dry to being wet. Thus, quite subtle changes in hydrophobic surface topology can profoundly influence the drying transition. We show that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid - vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse. This behaviour was unexpected because of the absence of drying in the collapse of the multidomain protein 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC).},

abstract = {Historically, the continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) progressive saturation method has been used to obtain information on the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) and those processes, such as motion and spin exchange, that occur on a competitive timescale. For example, qualitative information on local dynamics and solvent accessibility of proteins and nucleic acids has been obtained by this method. However, making quantitative estimates of T1e from CW-EPR spectra have been frustrated by a lack of understanding of the role of T1e (and T2e) in the slow-motion regime. Theoretical simulation of the CW-EPR lineshapes in the slow-motion region under increasing power levels has been used in this work to test whether the saturation technique can produce quantitative estimates of the spin-lattice relaxation rates, A method is presented by which the correct T1e may be extracted from an analysis of the power-saturation rollover curve, regardless of the amount of inhomogeneous broadening or the rates of molecular reorientation. The range of motional correlation times from 10 to 200 ns should be optimal for extracting quantitative estimates of T1e values in spin-labeled biomolecules. The progressive-saturation rollover curve method should find wide application in those areas of biophysics where information on molecular interactions and solvent exposure as well as molecular reorientation rates are desired.},

abstract = {We present an extensive molecular simulation study of the behavior of a flexible hydrophobic 25-mer polymer at interfaces presenting a range of chemistries from hydrophobic (-CH(3)) to hydrophilic (-CONH(2)). We quantify the free energy of adsorption, conformational equilibria, and translational and conformational dynamics of the polymer at these diverse interfaces. Water-mediated interactions drive the polymer to adsorb strongly at a hydrophobic interface and repel it from hydrophilic ones. At hydrophilic surfaces, van der Waals interactions between the polymer and the surface mitigate this water-mediated repulsion, leading to weak adsorption of the polymer. Although the polymer is strongly adsorbed to hydrophobic surfaces, it is also most dynamic there. Translational diffusion and conformational dynamics are faster at hydrophobic surfaces compared to those at hydrophilic ones. In bulk water, the polymer collapses into compact globular shapes, whereas the thermodynamic stability of folded polymers is significantly lowered at hydrophobic surfaces. The polymer spreads into pancake-like 2D conformations at hydrophobic surfaces and gradually beads up into globular shapes as the surface is made more hydrophilic. Interestingly, the binding thermodynamics and dynamics correlate with macroscopic droplet contact angles that characterize the wetting properties of the different interfaces.},

The macroscopic diffusion coefficient Dmacro for self-diffusion of 16-PC spin label is obtained from imaging the concentration profiles as a function of time, and it is (2.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-8) cm2/s at 22 degrees C. The microscopic diffusion coefficient Dmicro for relative diffusion of the spin probes is obtained from the variation of the spectral line broadening with spin label concentration, which is due to spin-spin interactions. Dmicro is found to be substantially greater than Dmacro for the same sample at the same conditions, and is estimated to be at least (1.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(-7) cm2/s. Possible sources for their difference are briefly discussed in terms of the models used for Dmicro.},

A physically motivated, nonpairwise-additive model of water-mediated interactions added to a protein structure prediction Hamiltonian yields marked improvement in the quality of structure prediction for larger proteins. Free energy profile analysis suggests that long-range water-mediated potentials guide folding and smooth the underlying folding funnel. Analyzing simulation trajectories gives direct evidence that water-mediated interactions facilitate native-like packing of supersecondary structural elements. Long-range pairing of hydrophilic groups is an integral part of protein architecture. Specific water-mediated interactions are a universal feature of biomolecular recognition landscapes in both folding and binding.},

By applying the constant phase element (CPE) approximation to model the electrical response of the MO solutions, we have verified that the formation of dimers and oligomers can be recognized by specific signatures in the loss and capacitive components of the dielectric response of the system. We interpret these well-defined changes in the dielectric properties of the solutions as a result of molecular rearrangements caused by the aggregation process that alter the current circulation pathways and the electric dipole distribution. The fact that these specific changes in the dielectric behavior coincide with critical concentrations where dimer and oligomer formation in pure aqueous MO solutions are known to occur suggests that electrical impedance spectroscopy can be a competitive technique for the investigation of aggregation behavior in dyes and surfactants.},

Better-fit results were found in these simulations. Data obtained from simulations revealed the effects of the polymer and surfactant counterion on the micelle formation and aggregation percentages. At about 8 mM SDS and about 12 mM LiDS concns., the presence of polymer provided more hydrophobic environment for 16-DS and this indicated that the location of the polymer was within the interface region.

The higher-concentration solutions show a component of the elastic fraction that we propose is due to water motions that are strongly coupled to the solute motions, while for low-concentration solutions an additional component is activated due to dynamic coupling between inner and outer hydration layers. An important difference between the solute types at the highest concentration studied is found from stretched exponential fits to their experimental intermediate scattering functions, showing more pronounced anomalous diffusion signatures for NALMA, including a smaller stretched exponent beta and a longer structural relaxation time tau than those found for NAGMA. The more normal water diffusion exhibited near the hydrophilic NAGMA provides experimental support for an explanation of the origin of the anomalous diffusion behavior of NALMA as arising from frustrated interactions between water molecules when a chemical interface is formed upon addition of a hydrophobic side chain, inducing spatial heterogeneity in the hydration dynamics in the two types of regions of the NALMA peptide. We place our QENS measurements on model biological solutes in the context of other spectroscopic techniques and provide both confirming as well as complementary dynamic information that attempts to give a unifying molecular view of hydration dynamics signatures near peptides and proteins.},

Polyhydric alcohols, free amino acids and their derivatives, and combinations of urea and methylamines are the three types of osmolyte systems found in all water-stressed organisms except the halobacteria. The selective advantages of the organic osmolyte systems are, first, a compatibility with macromolecular structure and function at high or variable (or both) osmolyte concentrations, and, second, greatly reduced needs for modifying proteins to function in concentrated intracellular solutions. Osmolyte compatibility is proposed to result from the absence of osmolyte interactions with substrates and cofactors, and the nonperturbing or favorable effects of osmolytes on macromolecular-solvent interactions.},

We evidence the critical importance of the solute concentration in determining the magnitude of the slowdown in water dynamics compared to the bulk situation. The comparison of concentrated aqueous solutions of tetramethylurea, which tends to aggregate, and of trimethylamine N-oxide, which does not, shows the dramatic impact of solute clustering on the water dynamics. No significant decoupling of the reorientation and translation dynamics of water is observed, even at very high solute concentrations. The respective roles of energetic and topological disorders in determining the translational subdiffusive water dynamics in these confining environments are discussed. The water reorientational dynamics is shown to be quantitatively described by an extended jump model which combines two factors determined by the local structure: the transition-state excluded volume and the transition-state hydrogen-bond strength.},

The AFM tip can also be used as a mechanical transducer and incorporated in electrochemical measurements of membrane components; therefore, we touch on these important applications in both model and cell membranes.},

abstract = {Sequential processing of multiply functionalized mesoporous films is shown to yield materials that are compositionally and structurally heterogeneous on mesoscopic and molecular length scales, both of which must be controlled to optimize macroscopic ion-conduction properties. Cubic mesoporous silica films prepared from strongly acidic solutions were subsequently functionalized under highly alkaline conditions to incorporate hydrophilic aluminosilica surface moieties, followed by nonaqueous conditions to introduce perfluorosulfonic-acid surface groups. Such sequential combination of individually incompatible steps yielded stable mesoporous films with high surface hydrophilicities and strong acid functionalities that exhibited high proton conductivities (ca. 9 × 10(-2) S/cm) at elevated temperatures (120 °C). Molecular, mesoscopic, and macroscopic properties of the multiply functionalized films were monitored and correlated at each stage of the syntheses by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, adsorption, and ion conductivity measurements. In particular, variable-temperature solid-state two-dimensional (2D) (27)Al\{(1)H\}, (29)Si\{(1)H\}, (27)Al\{(19)F\}, and (29)Si\{(19)F\} HETeronuclear chemical-shift CORrelation (HETCOR) NMR spectra reveal separate surface adsorption and grafting sites for the different functional surface species within the mesopore channels. The hydrophilic aluminosilica and acidic fluoro-group loadings and interaction sites are demonstrated to be strongly affected by the different synthesis and functionalization treatments, which must be separately and collectively optimized to maximize the proton conductivities.},

Studies with the spin label probes 5-, 12- and 16-doxyl stearic acid (DSA) indicated that both the order parameter and the rotational correlation times increased when the doxyl group was positioned closer to the headgroup region. These findings indicate that the fluidity of membranes decreased near the headgroup region. Comparing 16-DSA incorporated in vesicle formulations with either 30 or 70 mol\% showed no difference in alkyl chain mobility as was reflected by the order parameter. The rotational correlation times, however, showed a slowdown from 0.38 to 0.71 and 1.13 ns when the PEG-8-L molar content was decreased from 100 to 70 and 30 mol\% for PEG-8-L:L-595:CS vesicles, resp. Extrusion measurements indicated an increase in elasticity of vesicle bilayers as the molar content of PEG-8-L was increased from 10 to 90 mol\%. Incorporation of cholesterol sulfate stabilizes vesicles and thereby, decreases the elasticity. The increased elasticity correlated excellent with a redn. in the rotational correlation times obsd. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that when the molar content of the single chain non-ionic surfactant PEG-8-L in vesicles is increased the elasticity is enhanced and the rotational correlation time is reduced. The enhanced elasticity might contribute to an optimal design of vesicles as drug carriers for transdermal application. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Multivalency and preorganization are fundamental aspects of molecular recognition at the lipid membrane-water interface and can render weak monomeric binding interactions selective and robust; this concept is important throughout biology, biotechnology, and materials science. Though hydrogen bonding is typically weakened in water, intramembrane hydrogen bonding between native lipids has been well-studied and is thought to contribute to lipid bioactivity and membrane function. We hypothesized that avidity and preorganization effects at the lipid-water interface could overcome solvent competition and allow for selective hydrogen-bond recognition between small, unstructured components. We have found that electrostatically identical vesicular membranes composed of cyanuric acid and melamine functionalized phospholipids 1 and 2 undergo selective apposition, fusion and adhesion in suspension and on solid support, indicating that their well-known low-dielectric hydrogen bonding properties translate effectively to the lipid-water interface. This work is notable and of general interest given the few detailed studies of aqueous phase hydrogen-bonding systems; we have extensively characterized this system, gaining structural, functional, and thermodynamic data. Furthermore, we have found that the designed lipid-lipid headgroup interactions result in dramatic alteration of the lipid phase morphology, providing insight into the coupling of molecular interactions with assembly state. As such, this work contributes to our understanding of fundamental phenomena such as molecular recognition at the lipid-water interface membrane chemistry and further illustrates the general possibility of designing selective hydrogen-bonding adhesive interactions from simple starting materials at other polar-apolar interfaces; this could have numerous materials and biotechnological applications.},

@article{Tamogami2009,
abstract = {An electrochemical cell was previously reported in which bacteriorhodopsin (BR, purple membrane) was adsorbed on the surface of a transparent SnO(2) electrode, and illumination resulted in potential or current changes (Koyama et al., Science 265:762-765, 1994; Robertson and Lukashev, Biophys. J. 68:1507-1517, 1995; Koyama et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 68:400-406, 1998). In this paper, we concluded that pH changes caused by proton transfer by the deposited BR or proteorhodopsin (PR) films lead to the flash-induced potential change in the SnO(2) electrode. Thus, the signals originate from BR and PR acting as light-driven proton pumps. This conclusion was drawn from the following observations. (1) The relation between the potential of a bare electrode and pH is linear for a wide pH range. (2) The flash-induced potential changes decrease with an increase in the buffer concentration. (3) The action spectrum of PR agrees well with the absorption spectrum. (4) The present electrode can monitor the pH change in the time range from 10 ms to several hundred milliseconds, as deduced by comparing the SnO(2) signal with the signals of pH-sensitive dyes. Using this electrode system, flash-induced proton transfer by BR was measured for a wide pH range from 2 to 10. From these data, we reconfirmed various pK(a) values reported previously, indicating that the present method can give the correct pK(a) values. This is the first report to estimate these pK(a) values directly from the proton transfer. We then applied this method to flash-induced proton transfer of PR. We observed proton uptake followed by release for the pH range from 4 to 9.5, and in other pH ranges, proton release followed by uptake was observed.},

abstract = {Decades of molecular dynamics and normal mode calculations suggest that the largest-scale collective vibrational modes of proteins span the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. Experimental investigation of these harmonic, low-amplitude motions, however, has proven challenging. In response, we have developed a vector network analyzer-based spectrometer that supports the accurate measurement of both the absorbance and refractive index of solvated biomolecules over the corresponding gigahertz to terahertz frequency regime, thus providing experimental information regarding their largest-scale, lowest frequency harmonic motions. We have used this spectrometer to measure the complex dielectric response of lysozyme solutions over the range 65 to 700 GHz and an effective medium model to separate the dielectric response of the solvated protein from that of its buffer. In doing so, we find that each lysozyme is surrounded by a tightly bound layer of 165 ± 15 water molecules that, in terms of their picosecond dynamics, behave as if they are an integral part of the protein. We also find that existing computational descriptions of the protein's dynamics compare poorly with the results of our experiment. Specifically, published normal mode and molecular dynamics simulations do not explain the measured dielectric response unless we introduce a cutoff frequency of 250 GHz below which the density of vibrational modes drops to zero. This cutoff is physically plausible, given the known size of the protein and the known speed of sound in proteins, raising questions as to why it is not apparent in computational models of the protein's motions.},

Magnetic resonance properties of the agents have been examined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at 9.5 mT in water, isotonic saline, plasma, and blood at 23 and 37 degrees C, The relaxivities of the agents are about 0.2-0.4 mM(-1)s(-1) and the DNP enhancements extrapolate close to the dipolar limit. The agents have a single, narrow EPR line, which is analyzed as a Voigt function, The linewidth is measured as a function of the agent concentration and the oxygen concentration. The concentration broadenings are about 1-3 mu T/mM and the Lorentzian linewidths at infinite dilution are less than 1 mu T in water at room temperature. The longitudinal electron spin relaxation rate is calculated from the DNP enhancement curves. The oxygen broadening in water is about 50 mu T/mM O-2 at 37 degrees C. These agents have good properties for oximetry with OMRI. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Biological water at the interface of proteins is critical to their equilibrium structures and enzyme function and to phenomena such as molecular recognition and protein-protein interactions. To actually probe the dynamics of water structure at the surface, we must examine the protein itself, without disrupting the native structure, and the ultrafast elementary processes of hydration. Here we report direct study, with femtosecond resolution, of the dynamics of hydration at the surface of the enzyme protein Subtilisin Carlsberg, whose single Trp residue (Trp-113) was used as an intrinsic biological fluorescent probe. For the protein, we observed two well separated dynamical solvation times, 0.8 ps and 38 ps, whereas in bulk water, we obtained 180 fs and 1.1 ps. We also studied a covalently bonded probe at a separation of approximately 7 A and observed the near disappearance of the 38-ps component, with solvation being practically complete in (time constant) 1.5 ps. The degree of rigidity of the probe (anisotropy decay) and of the water environment (protein vs. micelle) was also studied. These results show that hydration at the surface is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories, those that result from weak interactions with the selected surface site, giving rise to bulk-type solvation (approximately 1 ps), and those that have a stronger interaction, enough to define a rigid water structure, with a solvation time of 38 ps, much slower than that of the bulk. At a distance of approximately 7 A from the surface, essentially all trajectories are bulk-type. The theoretical framework for these observations is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Numerous imaging techniques have been developed and applied to evaluate brain hemodynamics. Among these are positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, Xenon-enhanced computed tomography, dynamic perfusion computed tomography, MRI dynamic susceptibility contrast, arterial spin labeling, and Doppler ultrasound. These techniques give similar information about brain hemodynamics in the form of parameters such as cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood volume. All of them are used to characterize the same types of pathological conditions. However, each technique has its own advantages and drawbacks. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: This article addresses the main imaging techniques dedicated to brain hemodynamics. It represents a comparative overview established by consensus among specialists of the various techniques. CONCLUSIONS: For clinicians, this article should offer a clearer picture of the pros and cons of currently available brain perfusion imaging techniques and assist them in choosing the proper method for every specific clinical setting.

The nitroxide spin adducts assoc. more strongly with DM-b-CD than the nitrones.

abstract = {Kinetics and particle size distributions in the spontaneous micelle-vesicle transformation of oleate vesicles are studied by dynamic light scattering and absorbance measurements. Depending upon the conditions, there are 2 different kinetic processes for vesicles formation, a cooperative and a uncooperative one. In particular, the time progress of vesicle formation follows a sigmoid behavior and it is accelerated by the presence of preformed vesicles, confirming that a cooperative micelle-vesicle interaction takes place. This effect is studied by adding fresh oleate surfactant to preformed, extruded (50 and 100 nm) oleate vesicles as well as to 50 and 100 nm extruded POPC (1-palmitoyil-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) liposomes. Both in the case of oleate and POPC the rate process of vesicle formation is remarkably accelerated with respect to the control (no preformed vesicles); and the final size distribution is very close to the narrowly distribution curve of the preformed vesicles, whereas in the control expt. (no preadded vesicles) a very broad distribution is obtained. The authors called this phenomenon the matrix effect to stress that preexisting vesicles or liposomes act as a matrix on the formation of the new ones. The time evolution of the particles av. radius after addn. of fresh surfactant is followed by the dynamic light scattering cumulant anal., and thus when oleate micelles are added to oleate vesicles, a slight increase of the av. dimensions is obsd., whereas in the case of oleate added to POPC liposomes, the final radius is actually smaller than the initial radius. This confirms that under certain conditions, fission of vesicles is possible. Finally, some theor. considerations on the kinetics of the micelle-vesicle cooperative transformation are drawn.

abstract = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) employs paramagnetic species to increase the NMR signal of nuclear spins. In liquids, the efficiency of the effect depends on the strength of the interaction between the electron and nuclear spins and the time scales on which this interaction is modulated by the physical motion of the spin-bearing molecules. An approach to quantitatively predict the contribution of molecular motions to the DNP enhancement using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is developed and illustrated for the nitroxide radical TEMPOL in liquid toluene. A multi-resolution strategy that combines explicit treatment of the solvent at short distances from the free radical with implicit description at large intermolecular distances is adopted. Novel analytical expressions are obtained to correct for the finite spatial extent of the MD simulations. The atomistic and analytical descriptions are sewn seamlessly together by ensuring that for molecular trajectories that start in the near (explicit) region and end in the distant (implicit) region the analytical dipolar spectral densities reproduce the MD estimates. The spectral densities obtained from the developed approach are used to calculate DNP coupling factors separately for the ring and methyl protons of toluene. The agreement with previously reported experimental DNP data at a magnetic field of 3.4 T is noteworthy and encouraging. Maximum obtainable DNP enhancements at other magnetic fields are predicted.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus Type-1 (HIV-1) protease is crucial for viral maturation and infectivity. Studies of protease dynamics suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrophobic core is essential for enzyme activity. Many mutations in the hydrophobic core are also associated with drug resistance and may modulate the core flexibility. To test the role of flexibility in protease activity, pairs of cysteines were introduced at the interfaces of flexible regions remote from the active site. Disulfide bond formation was confirmed by crystal structures and by alkylation of free cysteines and mass spectrometry. Oxidized and reduced crystal structures of these variants show the overall structure of the protease is retained. However, cross-linking the cysteines led to drastic loss in enzyme activity, which was regained upon reducing the disulfide cross-links. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that altered dynamics propagated throughout the enzyme from the engineered disulfide. Thus, altered flexibility within the hydrophobic core can modulate HIV-1 protease activity, supporting the hypothesis that drug resistant mutations distal from the active site can alter the balance between substrate turnover and inhibitor binding by modulating enzyme activity.},

abstract = {Hydrophobicity is thought to underlie self-assembly in biological systems. However, the protein surface comprises hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches, and understanding the impact of such a chemical heterogeneity on protein self-assembly in water is of fundamental interest. Here, we report structural and thermodynamic investigations on the dimer formation of full-length amyloid-$\beta$ proteins in water associated with Alzheimer's disease. Spontaneous dimerization process--from the individual diffusive regime at large separations, through the approach stage in which two proteins come close to each other, to the structural adjustment stage toward compact dimer formation--was captured in full atomic detail via unguided, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. The integral-equation theory of liquids was then applied to simulated protein structures to analyze hydration thermodynamic properties and the water-mediated interaction between proteins. We demonstrate that hydrophilic residues play a key role in initiating the dimerization process. A long-range hydration force of enthalpic origin acting on the hydrophilic residues provides the major thermodynamic force that drives two proteins to approach from a large separation to a contact distance. After two proteins make atomic contacts, the nature of the water-mediated interaction switches from a long-range enthalpic attraction to a short-range entropic one. The latter acts both on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Along with the direct protein-protein interactions that lead to the formation of intermonomer hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, the water-mediated attraction of entropic origin brings about structural adjustment of constituent monomer proteins toward the formation of a compact dimer structure.},

abstract = {A review. Supramol. complexes can be studied by a variety of spectroscopic methods and substantial information obtained by optical methods, by NMR spectroscopy, and by other techniques, elucidating structure and their stability, are reported in the scientific literature. However, very few data can be found concerning the rates by which these aggregates are formed or dissocd. into sep. species. This is due to the fact that assocn./dissocn. takes place in a frequency range that is not accessible (or it is accessible only in very peculiar situations) either to optical techniques or to NMR. Thus distinct signals from the free and complexed species are detected with optical spectroscopies, while spectra representing concn.-weighted avs. are obsd. by NMR since the exchange between free and complexed species is usually too fast in the NMR time scale. The assocn./dissocn. processes, taking place in the time range between 10-5 and 10-9 seconds, can instead be studied very conveniently by EPR spectroscopy. Thus, this technique has been found among those more suitable to investigate the kinetics of assocn. and dissocn. in supramol. chem. and has provided valuable mechanistic information on the dynamics of these processes. In this review the results of our EPR studies on the supramol. species formed in aq. solns. with the guest benzyl tert-Bu nitroxide or related nitroxides and different host systems will be reported.

Correlation of relaxation time constants, such as T(1) and T(2), conceptually similar to the conventional multidimensional spectroscopy, have been difficult to determine primarily due to the absense of an efficient multidimensional Laplace inversion program. We demonstrate the use of a novel computer algorithm for fast two-dimensional inverse Laplace transformation to obtain T(1)--T(2) correlation functions. The algorithm efficiently performs a least-squares fit on two-dimensional data with a nonnegativity constraint. We use a regularization method to find a balance between the residual fitting errors and the known noise amplitude, thus producing a result that is found to be stable in the presence of noise. This algorithm can be extended to include functional forms other than exponential kernels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm at different signal-to-noise ratios and with different T(1)--T(2) spectral characteristics using several brine-saturated rock samples.},

We present a structural ensemble of ubiquitin, refined against residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), comprising solution dynamics up to microseconds. The ensemble covers the complete structural heterogeneity observed in 46 ubiquitin crystal structures, most of which are complexes with other proteins. Conformational selection, rather than induced-fit motion, thus suffices to explain the molecular recognition dynamics of ubiquitin. Marked correlations are seen between the flexibility of the ensemble and contacts formed in ubiquitin complexes. A large part of the solution dynamics is concentrated in one concerted mode, which accounts for most of ubiquitin's molecular recognition heterogeneity and ensures a low entropic complex formation cost.},

abstract = {Combining optimal control theory with a new RF limiting step produces pulses with significantly reduced duration and improved performance for a given maximum RF amplitude compared to previous broadband excitation by optimized pulses (BEBOP). The resulting pulses tolerate variations in RF homogeneity relevant for standard high-resolution NMR probes. Design criteria were transformation of Iz-->Ix over resonance offsets of +/-20kHz and RF variability of +/-5\%, with a pulse length of 500 micros and peak RF amplitude equal to 17.5 kHz. Simulations transform Iz to greater than 0.995 Ix, with phase deviations of the final magnetization less than 2 degrees, over ranges of resonance offset and RF variability that exceed the design targets. Experimental performance of the pulse is in excellent agreement with the simulations. Performance tradeoffs for yet shorter pulses or pulses with decreased digitization are also investigated.},

@article{IsueltLynch2003,
abstract = {A systematic comparison of the effect of architectural modifications to the network structure on the internal microstructure of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) based hydrogels showed that the addition of a second component to the network significantly increased the proportion of macropores in the network. The second components considered were short poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chains grafted to the network backbone, high-molecular-weight polyacrylamide (PAM) chains, or microsphere particles of PNIPAM. Structures are proposed for each of the modified gel networks taking into account the new structural information. Through a combination of the pore size and network structure data reported here, and with the shrinking data obtained previously, shrinking mechanisms are proposed for each of the modified network structures. In all cases, the enhanced shrinking rates were directly caused by the presence of the second component, which acted as nuclei for shrinking (graft-PNIPAM and PNIPAM microspheres) or as water-release channels (PAM gel), and indirectly caused by the second components via their affect on the network microstructure.},

abstract = {Potentials of mean force between single Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations and a highly charged spherical macroion in SPC/E water have been determined using molecular dynamics simulations. Results are compared to the electrostatic energy calculations for the primitive polarization model (PPM) of hydrated cations describing the ion hydration shell as a dielectric sphere of low permittivity (Gavryushov, S.; Linse, P. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 7135). Parameters of the ion dielectric sphere and radius of the macroion/water dielectric boundary were extracted by means of this comparison to approximate the short-range repulsion of ions near the interface. To explore the counterion distributions around a simplified model of DNA, the obtained PPM parameters for Na+ and Ca2+ have been substituted into the modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) equations derived for the PPM and named the epsilon-MPB (epsilon-MPB) theory. epsilon-MPB results for DNA suggest that such polarization effects are important in the case of 2:1 electrolyte and highly charged macromolecules. The three-dimensional implementation of the epsilon-MPB theory was also applied to calculation of the energies of interaction between two parallel macromolecules of DNA in solutions of NaCl and CaCl2. Being compared to results of MPB calculations without the ion polarization effects, it suggests that the ion hydration shell polarization and inhomogeneous solvent permittivity might be essential factors in the experimentally known hydration forces acting between charged macromolecules and bilayers at separations of less than 20 A between their surfaces.},

abstract = {An extensive set of electron spin resonance spectra was obtained over a wide range of frequencies (9, 95, 170, and 240 GHz) and temperatures (2 to 32 degrees C) to explore the dynamic modes of nitroxide-labeled T4 lysozyme in solution. A commonly used nitroxide side chain (R1), or a methylated analogue with hindered internal motion (R2), was substituted for the native side chain at solvent-exposed helical sites, 72 or 131. The spectra at all four frequencies were simultaneously fit with the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) model. Good fits were achieved at all the temperatures. Two principle dynamic modes are included in the SRLS model, the global tumbling of the protein and the internal motion consisting of backbone fluctuations and side chain isomerizations. Three distinct spectral components were required for R1 and two for R2 to account for the spectra at all temperatures. One is a highly ordered and slow motional component, which is observed in the spectra of both R1 and R2; it may correspond to conformers stabilized by interaction with the protein surface. The fraction of this component decreases with increasing temperature and is more populated in the R2 spectra, possibly arising from stronger interaction of the nitroxide ring with the protein surface due to the additional methyl group. The other two components of R1 and the second component of R2 are characterized by fast anisotropic diffusion and relatively low ordering, most likely corresponding to conformers having little or no interactions with nearby residues. Ficoll of different concentrations was added to increase the solution viscosity, thereby slowing down the global tumbling of the protein. A significant effect of Ficoll on the internal motion of an immobilized component was apparent in R2 but not in R1. The ability of such multifrequency studies to separate the effects of faster internal modes of motion from slower overall motions is clearly demonstrated, and its utility in future studies is considered.},

Characteristic length scales include the Debye length, the Van der Waals radius, the action distance of hydrogen bonding, the slip length, and macromolecular dimensions. On the basis of the characteristic lengths and related nanofluidic phenomena, a nanofluidic toolbox will be assembled. Nanofluidic phenomena that affect biomolecule behavior within such devices can include ion depletion and enrichment, modified velocity and mobility, permselectivity, steric hindrance, entropy, adsorption, and hydrodynamic interaction. The complex interactions and coupled physics of such phenomena allow for many applications, including biomolecule separation, concentration, reaction/hybridization, sequencing (in the case of DNA) and detection. Examples of devices for such applications will be presented, followed by a discussion of near-term challenges and future thoughts for the field.},

@article{Der2007,
abstract = {A phenomenological theory of salt-induced Hofmeister phenomena is presented, based on a relation between protein solubility in salt solutions and protein-water interfacial tension. As a generalization of previous treatments, it implies that both kosmotropic salting out and chaotropic salting in are manifested via salt-induced changes of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of protein-water interfaces. The theory is applied to describe the salt-dependent free energy profiles of proteins as a function of their water-exposed surface area. On this basis, three classes of protein conformations have been distinguished, and their existence experimentally demonstrated using the examples of bacteriorhodopsin and myoglobin. The experimental results support the ability of the new formalism to account for the diverse manifestations of salt effects on protein conformation, dynamics, and stability, and to resolve the puzzle of chaotropes stabilizing certain proteins (and other anomalies). It is also shown that the relation between interfacial tension and protein structural stability is straightforwardly linked to protein conformational fluctuations, providing a keystone for the microscopic interpretation of Hofmeister effects. Implications of the results concerning the use of Hofmeister effects in the experimental study of protein function are discussed.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins reside in a structured environment in which some of their residues are accessible to water, some are in contact with alkyl chains of lipid molecules, and some are buried in the protein. Water accessibility of residues may change during folding or function-related structural dynamics. Several techniques based on the combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with site-directed spin labeling can be used to quantify such water accessibility. Accessibility parameters for different residues in major plant light-harvesting complex IIb are determined by electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy in the presence of deuterated water, deuterium contrast in transversal relaxation rates, analysis of longitudinal relaxation rates, and line shape analysis of electron-spin-echo-detected EPR spectra as well as by the conventional techniques of measuring the maximum hyperfine splitting and progressive saturation in continuous-wave EPR. Systematic comparison of these parameters allows for a more detailed characterization of the environment of the spin-labeled residues. These techniques are applicable independently of protein size and require approximately 10-20 nmol of singly spin-labeled protein per sample. For a residue close to the N-terminus, in a domain unresolved in the existing x-ray structures of light-harvesting complex IIb, all methods indicate high water accessibility.},

The main corrugated line (22-mm internal diameter, 2.4-m long) connects the gyrotron output to the DNP probe input. The directional coupler, inserted approximately midway, is a four-port crossed waveguide beamsplitter design. Two beamsplitters, a quartz plate and ten-wire array, were tested with output coupling of 2.5\% (-16dB) at 250.6 GHz and 1.6\% (-18dB), respectively. A pair of mirrors in the DNP probe transferred the gyrotron beam from the 22-mm waveguide to an 8-mm helically corrugated waveguide for transmission through the final 0.58-m distance inside the NMR magnet to the sample. The transmission-line components were all cold tested with a 248/spl plusmn/4-GHz radiometer. A total insertion loss of 0.8 dB was achieved for HE/sub 11/-mode propagation from the gyrotron to the sample with only 1\% insertion loss for the 22-mm-diameter waveguide. A clean Gaussian gyrotron beam at the waveguide output and reliable forward power monitoring were achieved for many hours of continuous operation. },

@article{Tarasek2010,
abstract = {Electrostatic influences on NMR parameters are well accepted. Experimental and computational routes have been long pursued to understand and utilize such Stark effects. However, existing approaches are largely indirect informants on electric fields, and/or are complicated by multiple causal factors in spectroscopic change. We present a system to directly measure quadrupolar Stark effects from an applied electric (E) field. Our apparatus and applications are relevant in two contexts. Each uses a radiofrequency (rf) E field at twice the nuclear Larmor frequency (2omega(0)). The mechanism is a distortion of the E-field gradient tensor that is linear in the amplitude (E(0)) of the rf E field. The first uses 2omega(0) excitation of double-quantum transitions for times similar to T(1) (the longitudinal spin relaxation time). This perturbs the steady state distribution of spin population. Nonlinear analysis versus E(0) can be used to determine the Stark response rate. The second context uses POWER (perturbations observed with enhanced resolution) NMR. Here, coherent, short-time (<<T(2), the transverse relaxation rate) excitation at 2omega(0) is synchronized with an NMR multiple-pulse line-narrowing sequence. Linear analysis of the Stark response is then possible: a quadrupolar multiplet with splitting proportional to E(0). The POWER sequence converts the 2omega(0) interaction from off-diagonal/nonsecular to the familiar diagonal form (I(z)(2)) of static quadrupole interactions. Meanwhile, background contributions to line width are averaged to zero, providing orders-of-magnitude resolution enhancement for correspondingly high sensitivity to the Stark effect. Using GaAs as a test case with well-defined Stark response, we provide the first demonstration of the 2omega(0) effect at high-field (14.1 T) and room temperature. This, along with the simplicity of our apparatus and spectral approach, may facilitate extensions to a wider array of material and molecular systems. The POWER context, which has not previously been tested, is detailed here with new design insights. Several key aspects are demonstrated here, while complete implementation is to be presented at a later time. At present, we (1) account for finite pulse times in pulse sequence design, (2) demonstrate two-channel phase coherence for magnetic (omega(0)) and electric (2omega(0)) excitation, and (3) provide line narrowing by a factor of 10(3). In addition, we find that certain anomalous contributions to the line shape, observed in previous low-field (250 mT) applications, are absent here.},

abstract = {We investigate the thermal denaturation of human serum albumin and the associated solvation using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in aqueous buffer solution. Far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy reveal that the protein undergoes a native (N) to extended (E) state transition at temperature ≤55°C with a marginal change in the secondary and tertiary structure. At 70°C, the protein transforms into an unfolded (U) state with significant irreversible disruption of its structures. We measure the concentration- and temperature-dependent THz absorption coefficient ($\alpha$) of the protein solution using a p-Ge THz difference spectrometer (2.1-2.8 THz frequency range), thereby probing the collective protein-water network dynamics. When the solvated protein is heated up to 55°C and cooled down again, a reversible change in THz absorption is observed. When increasing the temperature up to 70°C, we find a dramatic irreversible change of THz absorption. The increase in THz absorption compared to bulk water is attributed to a blue shift in the spectrum of the solvated protein compared to bulk water. This is supported by measurements of THz absorption coefficients using THz time-domain spectroscopy (0.1-1.2 THz frequency range). We also use picosecond-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of the tryptophan 214 moiety of human serum albumin. All experimental observations can be explained by a change in the hydration dynamics of the solvated protein due to the additional exposure of hydrophobic residues upon unfolding.},

@article{Meyer2006,
abstract = {We present here a brief review of direct force measurements between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. For almost 70 years, researchers have attempted to understand the hydrophobic effect (the low solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water) and the hydrophobic interaction or force (the unusually strong attraction of hydrophobic surfaces and groups in water). After many years of research into how hydrophobic interactions affect the thermodynamic properties of processes such as micelle formation (self-assembly) and protein folding, the results of direct force measurements between macroscopic surfaces began to appear in the 1980s. Reported ranges of the attraction between variously prepared hydrophobic surfaces in water grew from the initially reported value of 80-100 Angstrom to values as large as 3,000 Angstrom. Recent improved surface preparation techniques and the combination of surface force apparatus measurements with atomic force microscopy imaging have made it possible to explain the long-range part of this interaction (at separations >200 Angstrom) that is observed between certain surfaces. We tentatively conclude that only the short-range part of the attraction (<100 Angstrom) represents the true hydrophobic interaction, although a quantitative explanation for this interaction will require additional research. Although our force-measuring technique did not allow collection of reliable data at separations <10 Angstrom, it is clear that some stronger force must act in this regime if the measured interaction energy curve is to extrapolate to the measured adhesion energy as the surface separation approaches zero (i.e., as the surfaces come into molecular contact).},

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a recently discovered ubiquitous eubacterial retinal-binding light-driven proton pump. Almost 1000 PR variants are widely distributed in species of marine and freshwater bacteria, suggesting PR's important photobiological role. PR is a typical seven-transmembrane [alpha]-helical membrane protein and as such poses a significant challenge to structural studies. Attempts to crystallize PR have not been successful, and its three-dimensional structure remains unknown. We show that PR reconstituted in lipids gives well-resolved magic-angle spinning NMR spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio. We report sequential assignment of 13C and 15N backbone and side-chain chemical shifts for 103 of 238 residues in PR, achieved by three-dimensional chemical shift correlation experiments performed on two samples with different patterns of reverse labeling. The chemical shift analysis gives a number of important structural insights not available from other studies: we have established protonation states of several carboxylic acids, identified the boundaries and distortions of transmembrane [alpha]-helices, and detected secondary structure elements in the loops. We confirmed that internal Asp227, which was proposed to form part of the Schiff base counterion, is ionized, while Glu142, which is located close to the extracellular surface, is neutral, in agreement with earlier predictions. We infer that, similar to bacteriorhodopsin's structure, PR has a proline kink in helix C, a non-proline kink in helix G, a short [beta]-turn in the B-C loop, and a short [alpha]-helical segment in the E-F loop.},

The sensor is composed of two half-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Omega impedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line resonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a cross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of the cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the relative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input ports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the microwave excitation at the center of the cross resonator. The third (output) port is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low temperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial lines mask the signal reflected by the resonator. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra recorded at low temperature in an S=5/2 molecular magnet system show that 82\% fidelity circular polarization of the microwaves is achieved over the central area of the resonator.},

abstract = {Generalized Born (GB) models provide, for many applications, an accurate and computationally facile estimate of the electrostatic contribution to aqueous solvation. The GB models involve two main types of approximations relative to the Poisson equation (PE) theory on which they are based. First, the self-energy contributions of individual atoms are estimated and expressed as "effective Born radii." Next, the atom-pair contributions are estimated by an analytical function f(GB) that depends upon the effective Born radii and interatomic distance of the atom pairs. Here, the relative impacts of these approximations are investigated by calculating "perfect" effective Born radii from PE theory, and enquiring as to how well the atom-pairwise energy terms from a GB model using these perfect radii in the standard f(GB) function duplicate the equivalent terms from PE theory. In tests on several biological macromolecules, the use of these perfect radii greatly increases the accuracy of the atom-pair terms; that is, the standard form of f(GB) performs quite well. The remaining small error has a systematic and a random component. The latter cannot be removed without significantly increasing the complexity of the GB model, but an alternative choice of f(GB) can reduce the systematic part. A molecular dynamics simulation using a perfect-radii GB model compares favorably with simulations using conventional GB, even though the radii remain fixed in the former. These results quantify, for the GB field, the importance of getting the effective Born radii right; indeed, with perfect radii, the GB model gives a very good approximation to the underlying PE theory for a variety of biomacromolecular types and conformations.},

abstract = {Dispersions of single-walled and non-associated carbon nanotubes in aqueous lysozyme solution were investigated by analyzing the stabilizing effect of both protein concentration and pH. It was inferred that the medium pH, which significantly modifies the protein net charge and (presumably) conformation, modulates the mutual interactions with carbon nanotubes. At fixed pH, in addition, the formation of protein/nanotube complexes scales with increasing lysozyme concentration. Electrophoretic mobility, dielectric relaxation and circular dichroism were used to determine the above features. According to circular dichroism, lysozyme adsorbed onto nanotubes could essentially retain its native conformation, but the significant amount of free protein does not allow drawing definitive conclusions on this regard. The state of charge and charge distribution around nanotubes was inferred by combining electrophoretic mobility and dielectric relaxation methods. The former gives information on changes in the surface charge density of the complexes, the latter on modifications in the electrical double layer thickness around them. Such results are complementary each other and univocally indicate that some LYS molecules take part to binding. Above a critical protein/nanotube mass ratio, depletion phenomena were observed. They counteract the stabilization mechanism, with subsequent nanotube/nanotube aggregation and phase separation. Protein-based depletion phenomena are similar to formerly reported effects, observed in aqueous surfactant systems containing carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy interrogates unpaired electron spins in solids and liquids to reveal local structure and dynamics; for example, EPR has elucidated parts of the structure of protein complexes that other techniques in structural biology have not been able to reveal. EPR can also probe the interplay of light and electricity in organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes, and the origin of decoherence in condensed matter, which is of fundamental importance to the development of quantum information processors. Like nuclear magnetic resonance, EPR spectroscopy becomes more powerful at high magnetic fields and frequencies, and with excitation by coherent pulses rather than continuous waves. However, the difficulty of generating sequences of powerful pulses at frequencies above 100 gigahertz has, until now, confined high-power pulsed EPR to magnetic fields of 3.5 teslas and below. Here we demonstrate that one-kilowatt pulses from a free-electron laser can power a pulsed EPR spectrometer at 240 gigahertz (8.5 teslas), providing transformative enhancements over the alternative, a state-of-the-art ∼30-milliwatt solid-state source. Our spectrometer can rotate spin-1/2 electrons through $\pi$/2 in only 6 nanoseconds (compared to 300 nanoseconds with the solid-state source). Fourier-transform EPR on nitrogen impurities in diamond demonstrates excitation and detection of EPR lines separated by about 200 megahertz. We measured decoherence times as short as 63 nanoseconds, in a frozen solution of nitroxide free-radicals at temperatures as high as 190 kelvin. Both free-electron lasers and the quasi-optical technology developed for the spectrometer are scalable to frequencies well in excess of one terahertz, opening the way to high-power pulsed EPR spectroscopy up to the highest static magnetic fields currently available.},

abstract = {The focus in protein folding has been very much on the protein backbone and sidechains. However, hydration waters make comparable contributions to the structure and energy of proteins. The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer. We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration. We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10 A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length usually observed.},

abstract = {A review. We succeeded recently in developing a series of new pathways to polymeric micelles and hollow spheres via intermol. specific interactions. A new micellization mechanism of block copolymers was realized by using the specific interaction between a low mol. wt. compd. and one of the blocks in low-polarity solvents. Many more successes have been achieved by our $\backslash$"block copolymer-free$\backslash$" strategies. We are now able to use homopolymers, random copolymers, oligomers, etc. as building blocks to construct noncovalently connected micelles (NCCM), in which the core and shell are connected by hydrogen bonding. Some of such NCCMs are readily converted further into hollow spheres by crosslinking the shell and then switching the medium to one that dissolves the core. Rigid polymer chains and their complementary homopolymers can directly assemble into large hollow spheres thanks to the propensity to parallel packing of the rigid chains. In addn., some of the NCCMs show perfect stimuli-responsive properties. PH-dependent micellization and pH-dependent micelle-hollow-sphere transition are realized in water-sol. graft copolymers driven by complexation and decomplexation between the main chain and grafts.

The CNT systems were constructed both with and without fluorine atoms covalently bound to the walls to elucidate the effects of the presence of a strongly hydrophobic environment, the fluorine, on proton dissociation, hydration, and stabilization. The simulations revealed that the dissociated proton was preferentially stabilized as a hydrated hydronium cation (i.e., Eigen like) in the fluorinated CNTs but as a Zundel (H(5)O(2)(+)) cation in the nonfluorinated CNTs. This feature is attributed to the fluorine atoms forming hydrogen bonds with the water molecules coordinated to the central hydronium ion.},

abstract = {For soln. NMR studies of the structure and function of membrane proteins, these macromols. have to be reconstituted and solubilized in detergent micelles. Detailed characterization of the mixed detergent/protein micelles is then of key importance to validate the results from such studies, and to evaluate how faithfully the natural environment of the protein in the biol. membrane is mimicked by the micelle. In this paper, a selection of paramagnetic probes with different physicochem. properties are used to characterize the 60 kDa mixed micelles consisting of about 90 mols. of the detergent dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) and one mol. of the Escherichia coli outer-membrane protein X (OmpX), which had previously been extensively studied by soln. NMR techniques. The observation of highly selective relaxation effects on the NMR spectra of OmpX and DHPC from a water-sol. relaxation agent and from nitroxide spin labels attached to lipophilic mols., confirmed data obtained previously with more complex NMR studies of the diamagnetic OmpX/DHPC system, and yielded addnl. novel insights into the protein - detergent interactions in the mixed micelles. The application of paramagnetic probes to the well characterized OmpX/DHPC system indicates that such probes should be widely applicable as an efficient support of NMR studies of the topol. of mixed membrane protein - detergent micelles.

Oleate vesicles represent a good model system in this framework due to the fact that they self-assemble spontaneously and that fatty acids are considered as possible prebiotic structures. In this contribution, we will focus the attention on the transition from oleate micelles to oleic acid/oleate vesicles induced by a pH change. This transformation is strongly influenced by the presence of pre-formed vesicles. We called this phenomenon the matrix effect. The influence of pre-added POPC liposomes (POPC = 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine) and oleic acid/oleate vesicles on the process rate and on the final size distribution will be discussed elucidating the main differences between these two systems.

A new stimulating effect of the field on the BR412 intermediate accumulation in the normal photochromic cycle of BR570 has been observed. The formation of the product BR412 is supposed to be accompanied by specific rearrangements of certain charged, polar and polarizable groups in the BR pigment-protein matrix. Such an intrinsic polarization could be promoted by an external electric field, the displacement vector of those groups being oriented in the direction of the filed.

abstract = {The microenvironment characteristics - polarity, viscosity and order degree - in Triton X-100 reverse micelles (RM) in cyclohexane and benzene - n-hexane 30:70 (vol./vol.), were investigated with the aid of a homologous series of cationic spin probes, CAT n, of 5- and 16-doxyl stearic acids and of a new absorption probe, 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (NP). The spectral parameters were related to local hydration values by means of a series of poly(oxyethylene) (PEO)/water calibration mixts. All results regarding the polarities in RM and calibration mixts. have been expressed in terms of Kosower's Z values, by detg. the linear dependence of the transition energies of NP, ENP, on Z, for a series of polar solvents: Z = 3.008ENP -178.4 (in kcal mol-1). This way the relative radial positioning of all probes was established and could be compared with those of 1-methyl-8-oxyquinolinium betaine (QB) and methyl orange (MO), previously used in the same systems. A continuous variation of the polarity in the RM was evidenced with different probes, from the most polar region in the center, with the polarity of ethanol/water mixts. (CAT 1, CAT 4 and QB) to a region corresponding to tetraethylene glycol (TG)/water mixts. and triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TGME)/water mixts. (NP and CAT 8), to a region at the limits of the core, with the polarities of the triethylene glycol di-Me ether (TGDE)/water mixts. (MO) and to still lower values, found with the 16-doxyl probe, in the corona. At the same time, the different hydration dynamics at various depths in the micelles were followed showing earlier satn. in the outer regions of the core as compared to the central regions. The spin probes evidenced the compacting and ordering effects of water on the surfactant chains in the polar core and corona. From this point of view the RM in benzene-hexane appear to have a much lower viscosity in the polar core (over the whole range of water contents) as compared to those in cyclohexane. The order degree of the surfactant chains is lower too and the corona appears to be penetrable by an oil-sol. Cu complex, at variance with the cyclohexane system. All this data can be consistently explained by the loosening effect of benzene, solvating the surfactant chains in the corona. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {EPR irradiation by a train of inverting pulses has potential advantages over continuous-wave EPR irradiation in DNP applications; however, it has previously been used only at high field (5 T), This paper presents the design and testing of an apparatus for performing pulsed DNP experiments at 10 mT with large samples (17 ml). Experimental results using pulsed DNP with an aqueous solution of a narrow-linewidth Paramagnetic probe are presented. A maximum DNP enhancement of about -36 with a train of inverting pulses (width 500 ns, repetition time 4 mu s) was measured. A preliminary comparison showed that, when the same enhancement value is considered, the pulsed DNP technique requires an average power that is about three times higher than that required with the CW irradiation. However, for in vivo DNP applications it is very important to minimize the average power deposited in the sample. From the experimental results reported in this work, when considering the maximum enhancement, the pulsed technique requires only 2\% of the average power necessary with the CW DNP technique. We believe that this reduction in the average power can be important for future DNP studies with large biological-samples. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {At low temperature (below its freezing/melting temperature), liquid water under confinement is known to exhibit anomalous dynamical features. Here we study structure and dynamics of water in the grooves of a long DNA duplex using molecular dynamics simulations with TIP5P potential at low temperature. We find signatures of a dynamical transition in both translational and orientational dynamics of water molecules in both the major and the minor grooves of a DNA duplex. The transition occurs at a slightly higher temperature (T(GL) approximately 255 K) than the temperature at which the bulk water is found to undergo a dynamical transition, which for the TIP5P potential is at 247 K. Groove water, however, exhibits markedly different temperature dependence of its properties from the bulk. Entropy calculations reveal that the minor groove water is ordered even at room temperature, and the transition at T approximately 255 K can be characterized as a strong-to-strong dynamical transition. Confinement of water in the grooves of DNA favors the formation of a low density four-coordinated state (as a consequence of enthalpy-entropy balance) that makes the liquid-liquid transition stronger. The low temperature water is characterized by pronounced tetrahedral order, as manifested in the sharp rise near 109 degrees in the O-O-O angle distribution. We find that the Adams-Gibbs relation between configurational entropy and translational diffusion holds quite well when the two quantities are plotted together in a master plot for different region of aqueous DNA duplex (bulk, major, and minor grooves) at different temperatures. The activation energy for the transfer of water molecules between different regions of DNA is found to be weakly dependent on temperature.},

abstract = {Anomalous diffusion has been widely observed by single particle tracking microscopy in complex systems such as biological cells. The resulting time series are usually evaluated in terms of time averages. Often anomalous diffusion is connected with non-ergodic behaviour. In such cases the time averages remain random variables and hence irreproducible. Here we present a detailed analysis of the time averaged mean squared displacement for systems governed by anomalous diffusion, considering both unconfined and restricted (corralled) motion. We discuss the behaviour of the time averaged mean squared displacement for two prominent stochastic processes, namely, continuous time random walks and fractional Brownian motion. We also study the distribution of the time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble mean, and show that this distribution preserves typical process characteristics even for short time series. Recently, velocity correlation functions were suggested to distinguish between these processes. We here present analytical expressions for the velocity correlation functions. The knowledge of the results presented here is expected to be relevant for the correct interpretation of single particle trajectory data in complex systems.},

@article{Yancey2005,
abstract = {Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives, polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called ;compatible solutes', a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine), providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulfide (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast, and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules, perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic fibrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is a mechanism by which an event in one place of a protein structure causes an effect at another site, much like the behavior of a telecommunications network in which a collection of transmitters, receivers and transceivers communicate with each other across long distances. For example, ligand binding or an amino acid mutation at an allosteric site can alter enzymatic activity or binding affinity in a distal region such as the active site or a second binding site. The mechanism of this site-to-site communication is of great interest, especially since allosteric effects must be considered in drug design and protein engineering. In this review, conformational mobility as the common route between allosteric regulation and catalysis is discussed. We summarize recent experimental data and the resulting insights into allostery within proteins, and we discuss the nature of future studies and the new applications that may result from increased understanding of this regulatory mechanism.},

abstract = {Small and large hydrophobic solutes exhibit remarkably different hydration thermodynamics. Small solutes are accommodated in water with minor perturbations to water structure, and their hydration is captured accurately by theories that describe density fluctuations in pure water. In contrast, hydration of large solutes is accompanied by dewetting of their surfaces and requires a macroscopic thermodynamic description. A unified theoretical description of these lengthscale dependencies was presented by Lum, Chandler, and Weeks [(1999) J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570-4577]. Here, we use molecular simulations to study lengthscale-dependent hydrophobic hydration under various thermodynamic conditions. We show that the hydration of small and large solutes displays disparate dependencies on thermodynamic variables, including pressure, temperature, and additive concentration. Understanding these dependencies allows manipulation of the small-to-large crossover lengthscale, which is nanoscopic under ambient conditions. Specifically, applying hydrostatic tension or adding ethanol decreases the crossover length to molecular sizes, making it accessible to atomistic simulations. With detailed temperature-dependent studies, we further demonstrate that hydration thermodynamics changes gradually from entropic to enthalpic near the crossover. The nanoscopic lengthscale of the crossover and its sensitivity to thermodynamic variables imply that quantitative modeling of biomolecular self-assembly in aqueous solutions requires elements of both molecular and macroscopic hydration physics. We also show that the small-to-large crossover is directly related to the Egelstaff-Widom lengthscale, the product of surface tension and isothermal compressibility, which is another fundamental lengthscale in liquids.},

abstract = {Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy in the visible and IR range was utilized to study the primary reaction dynamics of the proteorhodopsin (PR) D97N mutant in comparison with wild type PR at different pH values. The analysis of the data obtained in the mid-IR closely resembles the results for wild type PR. The observation of the first ground state intermediate K is initially obscured by a complex reaction scheme of vibrational relaxation and heating effects, but its spectral signature clearly emerges at long delay times. In the visible range, a biexponential decay of the excited state within 30 ps and the formation of the K photoproduct is observed. The decay time constants derived for the D97N mutant in D(2)O are slightly larger than in H(2)O due to H/D exchange. This kinetic isotope effect is even less pronounced than for wild type PR at pH 6. These results support the current notion of a pH dependent hydrogen bonding network in the retinal binding pocket of PR and a weaker interaction between the retinal Schiff base and the counter ion complex compared to bacteriorhodopsin.},

Linearity was obsd. between the logarithm of rotational correlation time (tc) and 1/T in all systems. The tc value was analyzed by the theory of abs. reaction rate. The activation enthalpy (DH.dbldag.) of hydrophobic probes in the micelle was between those in H2O and dodecane, suggesting that the core was liq. like. On the contrary, DH.dbldag. of hydrophilic probes was greater than that in H2O. The activation free energy (DF.dbldag.) of the probes in the micelle was .apprx.1 kcal/mol greater than that in H2O. This increase of DF.dbldag. in the micelle was attributed to the small activation entropy (DS.dbldag.) in the case of hydrophobic probes in contrast to that of hydrophilic probes, in which a large DH.dbldag. was responsible for the increase. The position of the probes in the micelle is discussed on the basis of soly. in H2O, DH.dbldag., and hyperfine coupling consts. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {Biomacromolecular structures with a relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 50,000 to 100,000 (50K 100K) have been generally considered to be inaccessible to analysis by solution NMR spectroscopy. Here we report spectra recorded from bacterial chaperonin complexes ten times this size limit (up to M(r) 900K) using the techniques of transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy and cross-correlated relaxation-enhanced polarization transfer. These techniques prevent deterioration of the NMR spectra by the rapid transverse relaxation of the magnetization to which large, slowly tumbling molecules are otherwise subject. We tested the resolving power of these techniques by examining the isotope-labelled homoheptameric co-chaperonin GroES (M(r) 72K), either free in solution or in complex with the homotetradecameric chaperonin GroEL (M(r) 800K) or with the single-ring GroEL variant SR1 (M(r) 400K). Most amino acids of GroES show the same resonances whether free in solution or in complex with chaperonin; however, residues 17 32 show large chemical shift changes on binding. These amino acids belong to a mobile loop region of GroES that forms contacts with GroEL. This establishes the utility of these techniques for solution NMR studies that should permit the exploration of structure, dynamics and interactions in large macromolecular complexes.},

abstract = {The process of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be qualitatively understood by a simple heat contact between bodies of different heat capacities. These bodies are identified with the three thermal reservoirs corresponding to the electron Zeeman, the electron dipole-dipole and the nuclear Zeeman interaction. The primary cooling process itself, which consists of an off-resonance irradiation of the electron Zeeman reservoir, may be interpreted as a continuous and thus non-adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating frame of reference. In order to maximize the nuclear polarization in the case, when all three bodies are in contact with each other (EST model), it is immediately seen that the heat capacity of the electron dipolar reservoir has to be minimized. Furthermore, this graphical description is very helpful in illustrating, how the completely different approach to the DNP process, the solid effect model, can be implemented into the spin temperature theory.

abstract = {A theory of nuclear spin relaxation in isotropic liquids for nuclear spins interacting with electron spins, residing in other molecules (the outer-sphere relaxation), is presented. The approach, valid outside of the Redfield limit for electron spin relaxation, is an extension of the Swedish slow motion theory [Benetis et al., Mol. Phys. 48, 329 (1983); Nilsson and Kowalewski, J. Magn. Reson. 146, 345 (2000)] for inner-sphere relaxation. It is demonstrated that the outer-sphere relaxation rate can be expressed as an integral of a product of a translational diffusion correlation function and a function analogous to the inner-sphere spectral density. A numerical implementation of the theory is described and applied to a large number of realistic parameter sets for S = 7/2 and S = 1, which may correspond to Gd(III) and Ni(II) systems. It is shown that the outer-sphere contribution is relevant and should be included into the analysis of nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion relaxation profiles, especially for slow relative translational diffusion and fast molecular tumbling.},

abstract = {Structure determination of homooligomeric proteins by NMR spectroscopy is difficult due to the lack of chemical shift perturbation data, which is very effective in restricting the binding interface in heterooligomeric systems, and the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of intermonomer distance restraints. Here we solved the high-resolution solution structure of the 15.4 kDa homodimer CylR2, the regulator of cytolysin production from Enterococcus faecalis, which deviates by 1.1 angstroms from the previously determined X-ray structure. We studied the influence of different experimental information such as long-range distances derived from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, residual dipolar couplings, symmetry restraints and intermonomer Nuclear Overhauser Effect restraints on the accuracy of the derived structure. In addition, we show that it is useful to combine experimental information with methods of ab initio docking when the available experimental data are not sufficient to obtain convergence to the correct homodimeric structure. In particular, intermonomer distances may not be required when residual dipolar couplings are compared to values predicted on the basis of the charge distribution and the shape of ab initio docking solutions.},

abstract = {A disulfide-linked nitroxide side chain (R1) is the most widely used spin label for determining protein topology, mapping structural changes, and characterizing nanosecond backbone motions by site-directed spin labeling. Although the internal motion of R1 and the number of preferred rotamers are limited, translating interspin distance measurements and spatial orientation information into structural constraints is challenging. Here, we introduce a highly constrained nitroxide side chain designated RX as an alternative to R1 for these applications. RX is formed by a facile cross-linking reaction of a bifunctional methanethiosulfonate reagent with pairs of cysteine residues at i and i + 3 or i and i + 4 in an $\alpha$-helix, at i and i + 2 in a $\beta$-strand, or with cysteine residues in adjacent strands in a $\beta$-sheet. Analysis of EPR spectra, a crystal structure of RX in T4 lysozyme, and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) spectroscopy on an immobilized protein containing RX all reveal a highly constrained internal motion of the side chain. Consistent with the constrained geometry, interspin distance distributions between pairs of RX side chains are narrower than those from analogous R1 pairs. As an important consequence of the constrained internal motion of RX, spectral diffusion detected with ELDOR reveals microsecond internal motions of the protein. Collectively, the data suggest that the RX side chain will be useful for distance mapping by EPR spectroscopy, determining spatial orientation of helical segments in oriented specimens, and measuring structural fluctuations on the microsecond time scale.},

abstract = {The epsilon-modified Poisson-Boltzmann (-MPB) equations ( J. Phys. Chem. B, 2007, 111, 5264) have been solved on a three-dimensional grid for an all-atom geometry model of B-DNA. The approach is based on the implicit solvent model including finite sizes of hydrated ions and a dielectric approximation of the ion hydration shell. Results were obtained for the detailed geometry model of B-DNA in dilute and moderately concentrated solutions of NaCl and CaCl(2). All -MPB parameters of ions and dielectric medium were extracted from published results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The study allows evaluations of the ion size, interionic correlation, and the solvent dielectric saturation effects on the ion distributions around DNA. It unambiguously suggests that the difference between the -MPB and Poisson-Boltzmann distributions of ions is low for Na(+) counterions. Such a difference in the case of divalent counterions Ca(2+) is dramatic: the dielectric saturation of the ion hydration shell leads to point-like adsorption of Ca(2+) on the phosphate groups of DNA. The -MPB equations were also applied to calculate the energy of interaction between two B-DNA molecules. Results agree with previously published simulations and experimental data. Some aspects of ion specificity of polyelectrolyte properties are discussed.},

We employed a home-built Alderman-Grant probe for the detection of ¹H NMR signal at 300 MHz, as such coils are well suited for higher frequency NMR detection. The Alderman-Grant coil is inductively coupled to the rest of the radiofrequency (rf) circuit, whose design allows probe components to be placed away from the sample area, and also enables easy switching of coils with different diameters and resonance frequencies. We have tested our DNP instrument on a frozen nitroxide model system consisting of 4-Amino TEMPO dissolved in a glycerol:water mixture. The largest nuclear spin polarization observed was 61 ± 2\% with a sample containing 20 mM 4-Amino TEMPO dissolved in deuterated glycerol (d-glycerol):D₂O:H₂O (50:40:10), amounting to record polarization measured to date at an easily amenable temperature of 4 K.},

abstract = {The proton conductivity of a Nafion 112 membrane is measured with a high spatial resolution using electrochemical atomic force microscopy. Image analysis reveals an inhomogeneous conductivity distribution which is attributed to the limited connectivity of hydrophilic domains. This information relates to the micro-morphology which is due to phase separation of the hydrophobic polymer backbone and the hydrophilic pendant groups. The direct images relate to a different length scale and are complementary to the x-ray diffraction investigations which provide only average information. Furthermore, the measured current values reveal an interesting correlation with the size of the conductive areas. A bimodal conductivity distribution suggests that there are different mechanisms which contribute to the proton current in Nafion. Additionally, time dependence in local conductivity is found and interpreted in terms of redistribution of water in the membrane. A statistical analysis of the current distribution is performed and compared with theoretical simulations. Evidence is found for the existence of a critical current density. On a timescale of seconds the response of the conductive network is probed by applying voltage steps to the atomic force microscope tip.},

The vis-pump/vis-probe experiments show a kinetic isotope effect that is more pronounced for alkaline conditions, thus decreasing the previously reported pH-dependence of the primary reaction of proteorhodopsin in H2O. This points to a pH dependent H-bonding network in the binding pocket of proteorhodopsin, that directly influences the primary photo-induced dynamics. The vis-pump/IR-probe experiments were carried out in two different spectral regions and allowed to monitor the retinal CC (1500 cm-1-1580 cm-1) and CN stretching vibration as well as the amide I mode of the protein (1590 cm-1-1680 cm-1).

abstract = {We report here our studies of hydration dynamics of confined water in aqueous nanochannels (approximately 50 A) of the lipidic cubic phase. By systematically anchoring the hydrocarbon tails of a series of tryptophan-alkyl ester probes into the lipid bilayer, we mapped out with femtosecond resolution the profile of water motions across the nanochannel. Three distinct time scales were observed, revealing discrete channel water structures. The interfacial water at the lipid surface is well-ordered, and the relaxation dynamics occurs in approximately 100-150 ps. These dynamically rigid water molecules are crucial for global structural stability of lipid bilayers and for stabilization of anchored biomolecules in membranes. The adjacent water layers near the lipid interface are hydrogen-bonded networks and the dynamical relaxation takes 10-15 ps. This quasi-bound water motion, similar to the typical protein surface hydration relaxation, facilitates conformation flexibility for biological recognition and function. The water near the channel center is bulklike, and the dynamics is ultrafast in less than 1 ps. These water molecules freely transport biomolecules near the channel center. The corresponding orientational relaxation at these three typical locations is well correlated with the hydration dynamics and local dynamic rigidity. These results reveal unique water structures and dynamical motions in nanoconfinements, which is critical to the understanding of nanoscopic biological activities and nanomaterial properties.},

Compn. of the complexes was varied by changing the pMAA/pNIPA molar ratio r and pH. Soly. of the pMAA/pNIPA complexes increased with increasing the content of pMAA in the complex and decreased with decreasing pH. According to HS-DSC, the phase transition behavior of pNIPA upon heating is significantly modified in complexes with pMAA. Thus, decreasing pH from pH 7 to 3 or increasing the content of pMAA decreases the phase transition temp. of the complexes by 4-5 DegC with respect to the lower crit. soln. temp. (LCST) of pure pNIPA. At the same time, the enthalpy of the transition decreases down to zero and the transition width increases by more than 1 order of magnitude. Thermograms of the sol. complexes (4.3 < pH < 6.3, r = 2.7) show an addnl. cooperative transition preceding the phase sepn. upon heating. This transition is accompanied by increasing the sedimentation coeff. of the complexes and decreasing their mean hydrodynamic diam.

abstract = {We investigated the influence of hydration water on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function in a biological membrane system. For the example of the purple membrane (PM) with its protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-driven proton pump, complementary information from neutron diffraction, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and dielectric spectroscopy will form a comprehensive picture of the structural and dynamic behavior of the PM in the temperature range between 150 and 290 K. Temperature- and humidity-dependent changes in the membrane system influence the accessibility of the different photocycle intermediates of BR. The melting of the 'freezing bound water' between 220 and 250 K could be related to the transition from the M1 to the M2 intermediate, which represents the key step in the photocycle. The dynamic transition in the vicinity of 180 K was shown to be necessary to ensure that the M1 intermediate can be populated and that the melting of crystallized bulk water above 255 K enables the completion of the photocycle.},

abstract = {The paramagnetic contributions to water-proton-spin-lattice relaxation rate constants in protein systems spin-labeled with nitroxide radicals were re-examined. As noted by others, the strength of the dipolar coupling between water protons and the protein-bound nitroxide radical often appears to be larger than physically reasonable when the relaxation is assumed to be controlled by 3-dimensional diffusive processes in the vicinity of the spin label. We examine the effects of the surface in biasing the diffusive exploration of the radical region and derive a relaxation model that incorporates 2-dimensional dynamics at the interfacial layer. However, we find that the local 2-dimensional dynamics changes the shape of the relaxation dispersion profile but does not necessarily reproduce the low-field relaxation efficiency found by experiment. We examine the contributions of long-range dipolar couplings between the paramagnetic center and protein-bound-water molecules and find that the contributions from these several long range couplings may be competitive with translational contributions because the correlation time for global rotation of the protein is approximately 1000 times longer than that for the diffusive motion of water at the interfacial region. As a result the electron-proton dipolar coupling to rare protein-bound-water-molecule protons may be significant for protein systems that accommodate long-lived-water molecules. Although the estimate of local diffusion coefficients is not seriously compromised because it derives from the Larmor frequency dependence, these several contributions confound efforts to fit relaxation data quantitatively with unique models.},

abstract = {Protein motions are essential for function. Comparing protein processes with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations, but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy, whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for the function of proteins.},

abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate a new single-electron contrast agent for Overhauser-enhanced MR imaging. The contrast agents that are currently available give enhancement factors that are too low to make the technique a valid option for routine clinical use. Material and Methods. MR images were generated directly following the injection of the substance into rats. The MR scanner was operated at a main magnetic field of 0.01 T and equipped with a separate rf-transmitter tuned to the electron paramagnetic resonance frequency of the contrast agent. Results. As expected, the images generated show a high level of enhancement in areas where the contrast agent was present, and a maximum enhancement of 60 times the normal proton signal was obtained in the vascular area. The signal-to-noise ratios in the images were superior to those previously attained. Conclusion: The new contrast agent makes it possible to generate MR images with both morphological and functional information at 0.01 T The signal-to-noise ratios found in the generated images were of the same order as, or better than, those obtained with the standard clinical routine. },

In line with its ability to measure diffusion parameters with great precision, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements have been made in association with innovative experimental strategies to monitor modes of molecular lateral diffusion within the plasma membrane of living cells. These investigations have allowed significant progress in the characterization of the cell membrane lateral organization at the suboptical level and have provided compelling evidence for the in vivo existence of raft nanodomains. We review these FCS-based studies and the characteristic structural features of raft nanodomains.

The NALMA-water system and the QENS data together provide a unique study for characterizing the dynamics of different hydration layers near a prototypical hydrophobic side chain and the backbone of which it is attached. We observe several unexpected features in the dynamics of these biological solutions under ambient conditions. The NALMA dynamics shows evidence of de Gennes narrowing, an indication of coherent long timescale structural relaxation dynamics. The translational and rotational water dynamics at the highest solute concentrations are found to be highly suppressed as characterized by long residential time and slow diffusion coefficients. The analysis of the more dilute concentration solutions models the first hydration shell with the 2.0 M spectra. We find that for outer layer hydration dynamics that the translational diffusion dynamics is still suppressed, although the rotational relaxation time and residential time are converged to bulk-water values. Molecular dynamics analysis of the first hydration shell water dynamics shows spatially heterogeneous water dynamics, with fast water motions near the hydrophobic side chain, and much slower water motions near the hydrophilic backbone. We discuss the hydration dynamics results of this model protein system in the context of protein function and protein-protein recognition.},

abstract = {The radial mode matching (RMM) method has been used to calculate accurately the microwave field distribution of the TE011 mode in a spherical EPR cavity containing a linear aqueous sample, in order to understand in detail the factors affecting sensitivity in EPR measurements at X band. Specific details of the experiment were included in the calculations, such as the cavity geometry, the presence of a quartz dewar, the size of the aqueous sample, and the sample's dielectric properties. From the field distribution, several key physical parameters were calculated, including cavity Q, filling factor, mean microwave magnetic field at the sample, and cavity efficiency parameter Lambda. The dependence of EPR signal intensity on sample diameter for a cylindrical aqueous sample was calculated and measured experimentally for non-saturated and half-saturated samples. The optimal aqueous sample diameter was determined for both cases. The impact of sample temperature, conductivity, and cavity Q on sensitivity of EPR is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of studies exploring the relationship between proteins' equilibrium dynamics and structural changes involved in function. An emerging concept, supported by both theory and experiments, is that under native state conditions proteins have an intrinsic ability to sample conformations that meet functional requirements. A typical example is the ability of enzymes to sample open and closed forms, irrespective of substrate, succeeded by the stabilization of one form (usually closed) upon substrate binding. This ability is structure-encoded, and plays a key role in facilitating allosteric regulation, which suggests complementing the sequence-encodes-structure paradigm of protein science by structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The emerging connection implies an evolutionary role in selecting/conserving structures based on their ability to achieve functional dynamics, and in turn, selecting sequences that fold into such 'apt' structures.},

abstract = {In this work we show the feasibility of sequential, co-registered fluorine and proton field-cycled Overhauser imaging at a detection field of 59 mT. To this purpose we have built an RF coil assembly comprising an Alderman-Grant resonator for EPR irradn. at 127.7 MHz (evolution field of 4.5 mT) and a solenoidal coil for 19F or 1H MRI acquisition at the detection field of 59 mT. A removable tuning/matching circuit that allows the solenoid to be tuned to the 19F frequency (2.346 MHz, FEDRI) or the 1H frequency (2.494 MHz, PEDRI) without removing the sample was built and tested. Switching of the solenoid between the 19F and 1H frequency is thus achieved in less than 1 min. The co-registered FC-FEDRI and FC-PEDRI images show higher enhancement in the sample regions with higher free radical concn. This work is the first methodol. step towards the development of an MRI scanner capable of acquiring morphol. (1H) and physiol. (19F) images in animal models at very low fields. [on SciFinder (R)]},

DNP requires irradiation at or near the electron Larmor frequency, and in this paper two probes are described to achieve this goal. Two new DNP probes were designed for electromagnets operating at a field of 1.4 T. In one probe, DNP can be combined with CPMAS. Compared to a similar probe reported previously, the main advantage of the new probe is the capability to spin vacuum-sealed samples with an improved filling factor. A second probe is based on an oversize microwave cavity. In this probe, large DNP enhancement factors can be obtained in nonlossy samples, e.g., a 1H enhancement factor of 260 for doped polystyrene.},

abstract = {The influence of electric surface charges on the polar headgroups and the hydrocarbon region of phospholipid membranes was studied by mixing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) with charged amphiphiles. A positive surface charge was generated with dialkyldimethylammonium salts and a negative surface charge with dialkyl phosphates. The POPC:amphiphile ratio and hence the surface charge density could be varied over a large range since stable liquid-crystalline bilayers were obtained even for the pure amphiphiles in water. POPC was selectively deuterated at both methylene segments of the choline moiety and at the cis double bond of the oleic acyl chain. Additional experiments were carried out with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine labeled at the C-2 position of the glycerol backbone. Deuterium, phosphorus, and nitrogen-14 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded for liquid-crystalline bilayers with varying concentrations of amphiphiles. Although the hydrocarbon region and the glycerol backbone were not significantly influenced by the addition of amphiphiles, very large perturbations of the phosphocholine headgroup were observed. Qualitatively, these results were similar to those observed previously with other cationic and anionic molecules and suggest that the electric surface charge is the essential driving force in changing the phospholipid headgroup orientation and conformation. While the P-N dipole is approximately parallel to the membrane surface in the pure phospholipid membrane, the addition of a positively charged amphiphile or the binding of cationic molecules moves the N+ end of the dipole toward the water phase, changing the orientation of the phosphate segment by more than 30 degrees at the highest amphiphile concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The saturation transfer electron spin resonance (STESR) spectra of 10 different positional isomers of phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled in the sn-2 chain have been investigated in the low temperature phases of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. The results of continuous wave saturation and of saturation recovery measurements on the conventional ESR spectra were used to define the saturation properties necessary for interpreting the STESR results in terms of the chain dynamics. Spin labels with the nitroxide group located in the center of the chain tended to segregate preferentially from the DPPC host lipids in the more ordered phases, causing spin-spin interactions which produced spectral broadening and had a very pronounced effect on the saturation characteristics of the labels. This was accompanied by a large decrease in the STESR spectral intensities and diagnostic line height ratios relative to those of spin labels that exhibited a higher degree of saturation at the same microwave power. The temperature dependence of the STESR spectra of the different spin label isomers revealed a sharp increase in the rate of rotation about the long axis of the lipid chains at approximately 25 degrees C, correlating with the pretransition of gel phase DPPC bilayers, and a progressive increase in the segmental motion towards the terminal methyl end of the chains in all phases. Prolonged incubation at low temperatures led to an increase in the diagnostic STESR line height ratios in all regions of the spectrum, reflecting the decrease in chain mobility accompanying formation of the subgel phase. Continuous recording of the central diagnostic peak height of the STESR spectra while scanning the temperature revealed a discontinuity at approximately 14-17 degrees C, corresponding to the DPPC subtransition which occurred only on the initial upward temperature scan, in addition to the discontinuity at 29-31 degrees C corresponding to the pretransition which displayed hysteresis on the downward temperature scan.},

These measurements can be performed in magnets of modest strength and low homogeneity and do not require pulsed gradients. As an illustration, we present measurements on a range of dairy products that include milks, yogurt, cream, and cheeses. The two-dimensional distribution functions generally exhibit two distinct components that correspond to the aqueous phase and the liquid fat content. The aqueous phase exhibits a relatively sharp peak, characterized by a large T1/T2 ratio of around 4. The diffusion coefficient and relaxation times are reduced from the values for bulk water by an amount that is sample specific. The fat signal has a similar signature in all samples. It is characterized by a wide T2 distribution and a diffusion coefficient of 10(-11) m2/s for a diffusion time of 40 ms, determined by bounded diffusion in the fat globules of 3 microm diameter.},

The donor probe (D) was attached via a succinimide group, consistent with the commonly-used maleimide conjugation chemistry, and the acceptor probe (A) was bound into the protein as occurs naturally for HEWL and the dye Eosin Y. The < k(2 >) is found to deviate significantly from the theoretical value and high correlation between the orientation factor kappa and the distance R is observed. The correlation is quantified using several possible fixed A orientations and correlation as high as 0.80 is found between kappa and R and as high as 0.68 between kappa(2) and R. The presence of this correlation highlights the fact that essentially all fluorescence-detected resonance energy transfer studies have assumed that kappa and R are independent - an assumption that is clearly not justified in the system studied here. The correlation results in the quantities <kappa R-2(-6)> and <kappa(2 >) < R-6 > differing by a factor of 1.6. The observed correlation between kappa and R is caused by the succinimide linkage between the D and HEWL, which is found to be relatively in flexible.},

abstract = {In recent years paramagnetic NMR derived structural constraints have become increasingly popular for the study of biomolecules. Some of these are based on the distance and angular dependences of pseudo contact shifts (PCSs). When modulated by internal motions PCSs also become sensitive reporters on molecular dynamics. We present here an investigation of the domain-domain motion in a two domain protein (PA0128) through time-modulation of PCSs. PA0128 is a protein of unknown function from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and contains a Zn(2+) binding site in the N-terminal domain. When substituted with Co(2+) in the binding site, several resonances from the C-terminal domain showed severe line broadening along the (15)N dimension. Relaxation compensated CPMG experiments revealed that the dramatic increase in the (15)N linewidth came from contributions of chemical exchange. Since several sites with perturbed relaxation are localized to a single beta-strand region, and since extracted timescales of motion for the perturbed sites are identical, and since the magnitude of the chemical exchange contributions is consistent with PCSs, the observed rate enhancements are interpreted as the result of concerted domain motion on the timescale of a few milliseconds. Given the predictability of PCS differences and the easy interpretation of the experimental results, we suggest that these effects might be useful in the study of molecular processes occurring on the millisecond to microsecond timescale.},

abstract = {The effects of cholesterol on the dynamics and the structural properties of two different spin probes, the sterol type CSL and the phospholipid type 16-PC, in POPC/cholesterol oriented multilayer model membranes were examined. Our results are consistent with a nonideal solution containing cholesterol-rich clusters created by the self association of cholesterol in POPC model membranes. The lateral diffusion coefficient D of the spin probes was measured over the temperature range of 15 to 60 degrees C and over the concentration range of 0 to 30 mol\% of cholesterol in the model membrane by the electron spin resonance (ESR) imaging method. The rotational diffusion coefficients (including R perpendicular) and the order parameter S were determined utilizing a nonlinear least square ESR spectral simulation method. D, R perpendicular and S of CSL deviate considerably from linear dependence on mole percent cholesterol. The D of CSL was decreased by a factor of four at 15 degrees C and a factor of two at 60 degrees C for concentrations of cholesterol over 10 mol \%, whereas those of 16-PC were hardly affected. Cholesterol decreased R perpendicular by a factor of 10 at 30 mol \% of cholesterol, but it increased slightly that of 16-PC. A significant increase of S for CSL due to the presence of cholesterol was observed. It is shown how the difference in variation of S for CSL vs. 16-PC with composition may be interpreted in terms of their respective activity coefficients, and how a single universal linear relation is obtained for the S of both probes in terms of a scaled temperature. Simple but general correlations of D and of R perpendicular with S were also found, which aid in the interpretation of these diffusion coefficients.},

Although the experiment superficially resembles the well-known Hartmann-Hahn cross polarization (CP) process introduced by Pines et al., that is widely used in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), it differs in significant respects. In particular, eNCP requires an alternative treatment due to the very different sizes of the specific terms in the spin Hamiltonian. We derive analytical expressions for the matching condition for optimal polarization transfer and verify their correctness with experimental results obtained with electron detected CP experiments performed on powder samples of BDPA radical dispersed in a protonated polystyrene matrix and with numerical simulations. We use fully protonated BDPA as an example of polarization transfer to strongly coupled nuclei. In contrast, perdeuterated BDPA serves as an example of the transfer of polarization from electrons to weakly coupled nuclei. In addition, we performed CP on a paramagnetic crystal to determine the influence of resolved hyperfine structure on the CP process. It is shown that almost no structure is observed in the corresponding electron-1H CP matching curve. It appears that only a restricted number of hyperfine coupled 1H's contribute to the observed signal intensities in the CP experiment.},

The interplay of intermolecular interactions at multiple time and length scales governs a fine-tuned system of reaction and transport processes, including particularly protein diffusion as a limiting or driving factor. Using quasielastic neutron backscattering, we probe the protein self-diffusion in crowded aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin on nanosecond time and nanometer length scales employing the same protein as crowding agent. The measured diffusion coefficient D(ϕ) strongly decreases with increasing protein volume fraction ϕ explored within 7\% ≤ ϕ ≤ 30\%. With an ellipsoidal protein model and an analytical framework involving colloid diffusion theory, we separate the rotational D(r)(ϕ) and translational D(t)(ϕ) contributions to D(ϕ). The resulting D(t)(ϕ) is described by short-time self-diffusion of effective spheres. Protein self-diffusion at biological volume fractions is found to be slowed down to 20\% of the dilute limit solely due to hydrodynamic interactions.},

abstract = {Two modifications of a conventional inversion-recovery experiment which exclude the effect of spectral diffusion on the measured spin-lattice relaxation times of rapidly tumbling nitroxide spin labels are described. In the first approach an almost uniform inversion is achieved by means of specially designed pulse trains with excitation patterns which match the three-line nitroxide ESR spectrum. In the second approach we essentially combine an inversion-recovery for the M(I) = 0 line with an analog of a pulsed ELDOR technique for M(I) = +/-1 lines in a single experiment; This allows us to reconstruct the recovery of the total magnetization of the ensemble of radicals which is not affected by spectral diffusion. The spin-lattice relaxation times of several nitroxide spin labels in different homogeneous and microheterogreneous environments are measured and compared. The temperature dependence of T-1 times is compared for two solvents, methylcyclohexane and carbon disulfide, which differ in nuclear spin concentration by almost a factor of 1000. The reported experimental evidence suggests that interactions with the nuclear spins of a solvent do not significantly contribute to the spin-lattice relaxation of nitroxide spin labels.},

Traditionally, the characterization of liquid surfaces has been limited to macroscopic experimental techniques such as surface tension and electrostatic potential measurements, wherein the microscopic picture then has to be inferred by applying theoretical models. Because the surface tension of electrolyte solutions generally increases with ion concentration, all inorganic ions have been thought to be repelled from the air-water interface, leaving the outermost surface layer essentially devoid of ions. This oversimplified picture has recently been challenged: first by chemical kinetics measurements, then by theoretical molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable models, and most recently by new surface sensitive experimental observations. Here we present an overview of the nature of the interfacial structure of electrolyte solutions and give a detailed description of the new picture that is emerging.},

In this paper, the results of the first precise ESR measurements of the deuterated target materials at a DNP-relevant magnetic field of 2.5 T are presented.

abstract = {The magnetic field dependence of the water-proton spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) in tissues results from magnetic coupling to the protons of the rotationally immobilized components of the tissue. As a consequence, the magnetic field dependence of the water-proton (1/T1) is a scaled report of the field dependence of the (1/T1) rate of the solid components of the tissue. The proton spin-lattice relaxation rate may be represented generally as a power law: 1/T1omega = Aomega-b, where b is usually found to be in the range of 0.5-0.8. We have shown that this power law may arise naturally from localized structural fluctuations along the backbone in biopolymers that modulate the proton dipole-dipole couplings. The protons in a protein form a spin communication network described by a fractal dimension that is less than the Euclidean dimension. The model proposed accounts quantitatively for the proton spin-lattice relaxation rates measured in immobilized protein systems at different water contents, and provides a fundamental basis for understanding the parametric dependence of proton spin-lattice relaxation rates in dynamically heterogeneous systems, such as tissues.

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; 13C homonuclear correlation spectra based on proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) are becoming increasingly important for obtaining distance constraints from multiply labeled biomolecules by MAS NMR. One particular challenging situation arises when such constraints are to be obtained from spectra with a large natural abundance signal background which causes detrimental diagonal peak intensities. They obscure cross peaks, and furthermore impede the calculation of a buildup rates matrix which may be used to derive distance constraints, as carried out in “NMR crystallography”. Here, we combine double quantum (DQ) filtering with 13C–13C dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) experiments to yield correlation spectra free of natural abundance contributions. Two experimental schemes, using DQ filtering prior to evolution (DOPE), and after mixing (DOAM), have been evaluated. Diagonal peak intensities along the spectrum diagonal are removed completely, and crosspeaks close to the diagonal are easily identifiable. For DOAM spectra with negligible mixing times, it is possible to carry out ‘assignment walks’ which simplify peak identification substantially. The method is demonstrated on 13C-cys labeled proteorhodopsin, a 27\&nbsp;kDa membrane protein. The magnetization transfer characteristics were studied using buildup curves obtained on uniformly 13C labelled crystalline tripeptide MLF. Our data show that DQ filtered DARR experiments pave the way for obtaining through space constraints for structural studies on ligands, bound to membrane receptors, or on small fragments within large proteins.},

abstract = {We describe a two-scale modeling approach toward anion specificity at surfaces of varying charge and polarity. Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at neutral hydrophobic (i.e., nonpolar) and neutral hydrophilic (i.e., polar) self-assembled monolayers furnish potentials of mean force for Na(+) and the halide anions F(-), Cl(-), and I(-) which are then used within Poisson-Boltzmann theory to calculate ionic distributions at surfaces of arbitrary charge for finite ion concentration. On the basis of calculated long-ranged electrostatic forces and coagulation properties, we obtain the direct anionic Hofmeister series at negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces. Reversal takes place when going to negative polar or to positive nonpolar surfaces, leading to the indirect series, while for positive polar surfaces the direct series is again obtained. This is in full accordance with a recent experimental classification of colloidal coagulation kinetics and also reflects the trends of the ion specific solubility properties of proteins. A schematic Hofmeister phase diagram is proposed. Partial series reversal is understood as a transient phenomenon for surfaces of intermediate polarity or charge.},

abstract = {To begin to elucidate the principles of intermolecular dynamics in the crowded environment of cells, employing brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, we examined possible mechanism(s) responsible for the great reduction in diffusion constants of macromolecules in vivo from that at infinite dilution. In an Escherichia coli cytoplasm model comprised of 15 different macromolecule types at physiological concentrations, BD simulations of molecular-shaped and equivalent sphere representations were performed with a soft repulsive potential. At cellular concentrations, the calculated diffusion constant of GFP is much larger than experiment, with no significant shape dependence. Next, using the equivalent sphere system, hydrodynamic interactions (HI) were considered. Without adjustable parameters, the in vivo experimental GFP diffusion constant was reproduced. Finally, the effects of nonspecific attractive interactions were examined. The reduction in diffusivity is very sensitive to macromolecular radius with the motion of the largest macromolecules dramatically slowed down; this is not seen if HI dominate. In addition, long-lived clusters involving the largest macromolecules form if attractions dominate, whereas HI give rise to significant, size independent intermolecular dynamic correlations. These qualitative differences provide a testable means of differentiating the importance of HI vs. nonspecific attractive interactions on macromolecular motion in cells.},

abstract = {Fluorescence solvent relaxation experiments are based on the characterization of time-dependent shifts in the fluorescence emission of a chromophore, yielding polarity and viscosity information about the chromophore's immediate environment. A chromophore applied to a phospholipid bilayer at a well-defined location (with respect to the z-axis of the bilayer) allows monitoring of the hydration and mobility of the probed segment of the lipid molecules. Specifically, time-resolved fluorescence experiments, fluorescence quenching data and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations show that 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan) probes the hydration and mobility of the sn-1 acyl groups in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. The time-dependent fluorescence shift (TDFS) of Laurdan provides information on headgroup compression and expansion induced by the addition of different amounts of cationic lipids to phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Those changes were predicted by previous MD simulations. Addition of truncated oxidized phospholipids leads to increased mobility and hydration at the sn-1 acyl level. This experimental finding can be explained by MD simulations, which indicate that the truncated chains of the oxidized lipid molecules are looping back into aqueous phase, hence creating voids below the glycerol level. Fluorescence solvent relaxation experiments are also useful in understanding salt effects on the structure and dynamics of lipid bilayers. For example, such experiments demonstrate that large anions increase hydration and mobility at the sn-1 acyl level of phosphatidylcholine bilayers, an observation which could not be explained by standard MD simulations. If polarizability is introduced into the applied force field, however, MD simulations show that big soft polarizable anions are able to interact with the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface of the lipid bilayer, penetrating to the level probed by Laurdan, and that they expand and destabilize the bilayer making it more hydrated and mobile.},

abstract = {Cerebral perfusion was assessed with 13C MRI in a rat model after intravenous injections of the 13C-labeled compound bis-1,1-(hydroxymethyl)-1-13C-cyclopropane-D8 in aqueous solutions hyperpolarized by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Since the tracer acted as a direct signal source, several of the problems associated with techniques based on traditional dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI contrast agents were avoided. Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated. The MTT was determined to be 2.8 ± 0.8 sec. However, arterial partial-volume effects in the animal model prevented accurate absolute quantification of CBF and CBV. It was demonstrated that depolarization of the hyperpolarized 13C tracer via relaxation and the imaging sequence had little influence on CBF assessment when the time resolution of the imaging sequence was short compared to the MTT. However, CBV and MTT were increasingly underestimated as MTT or the depolarization rate increased if depolarization was not taken into account. With a modified bolus-tracking theory depolarization could be compensated for, assuming that the depolarization rate was known. Three separate compensation methods were investigated experimentally and by numerical simulations. Magn Reson Med 51:464-472, 2004. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

It was shown that all these substances stabilize the protein structure against thermal denaturation and (except for trimethylamine N-oxide for which interaction measurements could not be made) are strongly excluded from the protein domain, rendering unlikely their direct binding to proteins. On the other hand, valine, not known as an osmolyte, had no stabilizing effect, although it induced a large protein-preferential hydration. A possible explanation is given for the use of these substances as osmotic-pressure-regulating agents in organisms living under high osmotic pressure.},

We report herein characterization of this synthetic membrane fusion reaction with regard to the following: effects of fusogen concentration, lipid composition, and membrane charge. Our findings indicate that these parameters are determinants of fusion rate, vesicle stability, peptide binding, catalytic fusion and membrane disruption during fusion. Notably, these data indicate the importance of coupling between molecular recognition and insertion for bilayer activation as well as the critical role of membrane subdomain formation for membrane fusion reactivity. These phenomena are general to lipid membrane chemistry, and therefore these findings provide a guideline for understanding more complex biomembrane systems.},

Similar to the two faces of a coin, several of these osmolytes are stabilizing and destabilizing proteins depending on the concentrations and/or solvent conditions. For example, the well known stabilizing osmolyte, trehalose destabilizes some proteins at high concentration and/or high pH. In spite of the fact that destabilizing aspects of osmolytes can modulate many cellular processes including regulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis), protein-protein interaction, and protein-DNA interaction, researchers have mostly focused on the stabilizing aspects of osmolytes. Thus, it is important to look into both aspects of osmolytes to determine their precise role under physiological conditions. In this article, we have discussed both stabilizing and destabilizing/denaturant aspects of osmolytes to uncover both sides of the coin.},

abstract = {In spite of heroic efforts, phospholipid bilayer models of fusion do not mimic the cellular process closely enough to be confident that the cellular mechanism is being probed. Probably the experimental factors that are most difficult to control are the uniformity of the vesicles and the constraints that determine their behavior. In most conditions where fusion is triggered, the probability of bilayer mechanical rupture and leakage is increased. Confining that rupture to the contact area remains the most elusive characteristic of cell fusion to mimic. It may depend on fusogenic proteins. Some membrane characteristics, such as lipid asymmetry, may be crucial and may be determined biochemically, but they are difficult to duplicate in model systems. The contact-induced formation of nonbilayer lipid structures triggered by phosphatidylinositol turnover may offer some guidance in how the biochemical and required physical changes may be coupled.},

abstract = {At 8.5 T, the polarization of an ensemble of electron spins is essentially 100\% at 2 K, and decreases to 30\% at 20 K. The strong temperature dependence of the electron spin polarization between 2 and 20 K leads to the phenomenon of spin bath quenching: temporal fluctuations of the dipolar magnetic fields associated with the energy-conserving spin "flip-flop" process are quenched as the temperature of the spin bath is lowered to the point of nearly complete spin polarization. This work uses pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 240 GHz to investigate the effects of spin bath quenching on the phase memory times (T(M)) of randomly-distributed ensembles of nitroxide molecules below 20 K at 8.5 T. For a given electron spin concentration, a characteristic, dipolar flip-flop rate (W) is extracted by fitting the temperature dependence of T(M) to a simple model of decoherence driven by the spin flip-flop process. In frozen solutions of 4-Amino-TEMPO, a stable nitroxide radical in a deuterated water-glass, a calibration is used to quantify average spin-spin distances as large as r=6.6 nm from the dipolar flip-flop rate. For longer distances, nuclear spin fluctuations, which are not frozen out, begin to dominate over the electron spin flip-flop processes, placing an effective ceiling on this method for nitroxide molecules. For a bulk solution with a three-dimensional distribution of nitroxide molecules at concentration n, we find W∝n∝1/r(3), which is consistent with magnetic dipolar spin interactions. Alternatively, we observe W∝n(32) for nitroxides tethered to a quasi two-dimensional surface of large (\O∼200 nm), unilamellar, lipid vesicles, demonstrating that the quantification of spin bath quenching can also be used to discern the geometry of molecular assembly or organization.},

abstract = {The adsorption isotherms and 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of xenon and the adsorption isotherms of carbon monoxide of Cu(II)- and Cu(I)-exchanged zeolites NaY were measured. The former zeolites of 53, 75, and 95\% exchange degrees were investigated after various pretreatment steps comprising dehydration, oxidation and reduction with CO at 420[degree sign]C as well as long-term CO reduction at 470[degree sign]C. The Cu(I)Y zeolite of 70\% exchange degree was prepared via a solid-state exchange procedure with CuCl and subjected to dehydration at 420[degree sign]C. In all cases, except the dehydrated zeolites, almost linear xenon adsorption isotherms and linear 129Xe NMR chemical shift versus xenon concentration curves running parallel to each other are obtained. In contrast, the chemical shift curves for the dehydrated zeolites are non-linear at low xenon concentrations turning towards negative chemical shift values at very low pressures. The whole body of the experimental xenon data can be explained quantitatively with a unifying approach on the basis of a site adsorption model where the sites are (i) two types of cuprous ions of much different adsorption strength and 129Xe chemical shift, (ii) Na+ cations, (iii) Lewis acid sites generated through autoreduction and reduction of Cu2+ by CO, and (iv) framework sites free of cations. These five types of sites are each characterized by Langmuir adsorption isotherm constants and local 129Xe NMR chemical shifts. The adsorption site concentrations in the various zeolites are evaluated. The supercage Cu(I) concentration values are in nice agreement with the results deduced from the CO adsorption isotherm measurements.},

abstract = {The dynamics and state of lipid bilayer-internal hydration water of unilamellar lipid vesicles dispersed in solutions is characterized. This study was enabled by a recently developed technique based on Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-driven amplification of (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal of hydration water. This technique can, in the full presence of bulk water, selectively quantify the translational dynamics of hydration water within ∼10 \AA around spin labels that are specifically introduced to the local volume of interest within the lipid bilayer. With this approach, the local apparent diffusion coefficients of internal water at different depths of the lipid bilayer were determined. The modulation of these values as a response to external stimuli, such as the addition of sodium chloride or ethanol and the lipid phase transitions, that alter the fluctuations of bilayer interfaces together with the activation energy values of water diffusivity shows that water is not individually and homogeneously solvating lipid's hydrocarbon tails in the lipid bilayer. We provide experimental evidence that instead, water and the lipid membrane comprise a heterogeneous system whose constituents include transient hydrophobic water pores or water structures traversing the lipid bilayer. We show how these transient pore structures, as key vehicles for passive water transport can better reconcile our experimental data with existing literature data on lipid bilayer hydration and dynamics.},

The magnetic nanorods were engineered to overhang the leading edge of the cantilever, and consequently the cantilevers experience what we believe is the lowest surface noise ever achieved in a scanned probe experiment. Cantilever magnetometry indicated that the tips were well magnetized, with a ≤ 20 nm dead layer; the composition of the dead layer was studied by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. In what we believe is the first demonstration of scanned probe detection of electron-spin resonance from a batch-fabricated tip, the cantilevers were used to observe electron-spin resonance from nitroxide spin labels in a film via force-gradient-induced shifts in cantilever resonance frequency. The magnetic field dependence of the magnetic resonance signal suggests a nonuniform tip magnetization at an applied field near 0.6 T.},

It is a necessary ingredient in most emerging quantum technologies, including quantum repeaters, quantum information processing and the strongest forms of quantum cryptography. Spin ensembles, such as those used in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, have been important for the development of quantum control methods. However, these demonstrations contain no entanglement and ultimately constitute classical simulations of quantum algorithms. Here we report the on-demand generation of entanglement between an ensemble of electron and nuclear spins in isotopically engineered, phosphorus-doped silicon. We combined high-field (3.4 T), low-temperature (2.9 K) electron spin resonance with hyperpolarization of the (31)P nuclear spin to obtain an initial state of sufficient purity to create a non-classical, inseparable state. The state was verified using density matrix tomography based on geometric phase gates, and had a fidelity of 98\% relative to the ideal state at this field and temperature. The entanglement operation was performed simultaneously, with high fidelity, on 10(10) spin pairs; this fulfils one of the essential requirements for a silicon-based quantum information processor.},

abstract = {D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) is a membrane-bound, lipid-requiring enzyme which has a reactive sulfhydryl in the vicinity of the active center. The spin-probe-spin-label technique has been used to estimate the distance of separation of the reactive sulfhydryl of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from the bilayer surface. The reactive sulfhydryl of the enzyme was derivatized with the maleimide spin-label reagent 4-maleimido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy in the presence of the cofactor NAD+. The derivatized enzyme, inserted (inlaid orientation) into phospholipid vesicles, was titrated with spin probes, either Mn2+ or Gd3+, until the spin-label EPR spectrum was reduced in amplitude to its residual (limiting) value. From this limiting amplitude, the dipolar interaction coefficient was obtained, which is related to the reciprocal of the distance to the sixth power. The radial distances of closest approach of the paramagnetic Mn2+ and Gd3+ ions to the spin-label nitroxide on the enzyme were found to be 18 and 16 A, respectively. These calculated distances were in accord with those determined by comparison with a phosphatidylcholine calibration system having 2,2-dimethyloxazolidinyl-1-oxy spin-labels located at selected positions along the sn-2 fatty acyl chain. Since the distal nitroxide moiety of the maleimide spin-label (17 A from the bilayer surface) is 8 A from the sulfhydryl addition site, the two limiting distances of immersion of the reactive sulfhydryl within the bilayer are 9 and 25 A. The shorter distance is considered more compatible with facile access of the coenzyme to the active site of the enzyme.},

The results show that the microenvironment of the spin probe in the polymer-surfactant aq. solns. depends strongly on the hydrated radius of the counterion. The headgroups of LiDS and SDS adsorbed on PEO are more tightly packed than those of the unperturbed micelles, which leads to a much more compact structure of the polymer-micelle complex.

abstract = {Proteins, the workhorses of living systems, are constructed from chains of amino acids, which are synthesized in the cell based on the instructions of the genetic code and then folded into working proteins. The time for folding varies from microseconds to hours. What controls the folding rate is hotly debated. We postulate here that folding has the same temperature dependence as the alpha-fluctuations in the bulk solvent but is much slower. We call this behavior slaving. Slaving has been observed in folded proteins: Large-scale protein motions follow the solvent fluctuations with rate coefficient k(alpha) but can be slower by a large factor. Slowing occurs because large-scale motions proceed in many small steps, each determined by k(alpha). If conformational motions of folded proteins are slaved, so a fortiori must be the motions during folding. The unfolded protein makes a Brownian walk in the conformational space to the folded structure, with each step controlled by k(alpha). Because the number of conformational substates in the unfolded protein is extremely large, the folding rate coefficient, k(f), is much smaller than k(alpha). The slaving model implies that the activation enthalpy of folding is dominated by the solvent, whereas the number of steps n(f) = k(alpha)/k(f) is controlled by the number of accessible substates in the unfolded protein and the solvent. Proteins, however, undergo not only alpha- but also beta-fluctuations. These additional fluctuations are local protein motions that are essentially independent of the bulk solvent fluctuations and may be relevant at late stages of folding.},

abstract = {A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain MRI. Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radiofrequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain CBF averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in CBF was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. CBF vs. pCO2 data yield a best-fit straight line described by CBF (ml.g-1.min-1) = 0.052pCO2 (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Phase contrast microscopy, solid-state NMR, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, and small-angle neutron scattering were used to characterize the phase behavior of these systems at molar ratio of fatty acid to Abd of 1 and 2. Whatever the Abd and the molar ratio, fatty acids were embedded at low temp. in a bilayer gel phase which crystallizes after a period of rest. At an equimolar ratio, the gel phases transited upon raising the temp. to an isotropic phase made of wormlike micelles except in the case of the ethylenediamine chain for which a lamellar fluid phase was obsd. At a molar ratio of 2 and high temp., fatty acids were embedded in a lamellar fluid phase which self-orients with its stacking axis perpendicular to the magnetic field.

abstract = {The adhesion forces between various surfaces were measured using the "surface forces apparatus" technique. This technique allows for the thickness of surface layers and the adhesion force between them to be directly measured in controlled vapor or liquid environments. Three types of biological surfaces were prepared by depositing various lipid-protein monolayers (with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 4 nm) on the inert, molecularly smooth mica surface: (i) hydrophobic lipid monolayers; (ii) amphiphilic polyelectrolyte surfaces of adsorbed polylysine; and (iii) deposited bacterial S-layer proteins. The adhesion, swelling, and wetting properties of these surfaces was measured as a function of relative humidity and time. Initial adhesion is due mainly to the van der Waals forces arising from nonpolar (hydrophobic) contacts. Following adhesive contact, significant molecular rearrangements can occur which alter their hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance and increase their adhesion with time. Increased adhesion is generally enhanced by (i) increased relative humidity (or degree of hydration); (ii) increased contact time; and (iii) increased rates of separation. The results are likely to be applicable to the adhesion of many other biosurfaces, and show that the hydrophobicity of a lipid or protein surface is not an intrinsic property of that surface but depends on its environment (e.g., on whether it is in aqueous solution or exposed to the atmosphere), and on the relative humidity of the atmosphere. It also depends on whether the surface is in adhesive contact with another surface and-when considering dynamic (nonequilibrium) conditions-on the time and previous history of its interaction with that surface.},

These include narrow line widths, the possibility of novel imaging schemes, reduced imaging artifacts from susceptibility variations within a sample, and reduced system cost and complexity. In addn., ULF NMR/MRI with superconducting quantum interference devices is compatible with simultaneous measurements of biomagnetic signals, a capability conventional systems cannot offer. Acquisition of MRI at ULF must, however, account for concomitant gradients that would otherwise result in severe image distortions. In this paper, we introduce the general theor. framework that describes concomitant gradients, explain why such gradients are more problematic at low field, and present possible approaches to correct for these unavoidable gradients in the context of a non-slice-selective MRI protocol.

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin, a homologue of archaeal bacteriorhodopsin (BR), belongs to a newly identified family of retinal proteins from marine bacteria, which could play an important role in the energy balance of the biosphere. We cloned the cDNA sequence of proteorhodopsin by chemical gene synthesis, expressed the protein in Escherichia coli cells, purified and reconstituted the protein in its functional active state. The photocycle characteristics were determined by time-resolved absorption and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The pH-dependence of the absorption spectrum indicates that the pKa of the primary acceptor of the Schiff base proton (Asp97) is 7.68. Generally, the photocycle of proteorhodopsin is similar to that of BR, although an L-like photocycle intermediate was not detectable. Whereas at pH>7 an M-like intermediate is formed upon illumination, at pH 5 no M-like intermediate could be detected. As the photocycle kinetics do not change between the acidic and alkaline state of proteorhodopsin, the only difference between these two forms is the protonation status of Asp97. This is corroborated by time-resolved FT-IR spectroscopy, which demonstrates that proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to Asp97 is observed at alkaline pH, but the other vibrational changes are essentially pH-independent. After reconstitution into proteoliposomes, light-induced proton currents of proteorhodopsin were measured in a compound membrane system where proteoliposomes were adsorbed to planar lipid bilayers. Our results show that proteorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump with characteristics similar to those of BR at alkaline pH. However, at acidic pH, the direction of proton pumping is inverted. Complementary experiments were carried out on proteorhodopsin expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes under voltage clamp conditions. The following results were obtained. (1) At alkaline pH, proteorhodopsin mediates outwardly directed proton pumping like BR. (2) The direction of proton pumping can be inverted, when Asp97 is protonated. (3) The current can be inverted by changes of the polarity of the applied voltage. (4) The light intensity-dependence of the photocurrents leads to the conclusion that the alkaline form of proteorhodopsin shows efficient proton pumping after sequential excitation by two photons.},

We assume here that a least-squares analysis is used to process magnetization data and that a first-order analysis is sufficient for practical values of the signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast to earlier analyses, we assume an initial uncertainty in the a priori knowledge of T1, specifically that T1 is known to be between TA and TB. We then calculate , i.e., the dimensionless standard deviation of the estimate of T1. The optimum set of measurement times $\tau$1, $\tau$2, \ldots, $\tau$3., is then defined to be that which minimizes the maximum of for T1 in the interval (TA, TB). The overall objective is that of obtaining maximum precision in the shortest time. We show how to calculate the optimum number of experiments required to achieve a specified precision and how to calculate the associated total spectrometer time. Finally, we calculate $\sigma$(T1)/T1, for experiments in which separate measurements are made of the equilibrium magnetization, M(∞).},

The confining cylindrical wall is hydrophilic and disordered, which has a destabilizing effect on ordered water structure. The phase diagram for this class of systems is derived from general arguments, with parameters taken from experimental observations and computer simulations and with assumptions tested by computer simulation. Phase space divides into three regions: a single liquid, a crystal-like solid, and glass. For large pores, radii exceeding 1 nm, water exhibits liquid and crystal-like behaviors, with abrupt crossovers between these regimes. For small pore radii, crystal-like behavior is unstable and water remains amorphous for all non-zero temperatures. At low enough temperatures, these states are glasses. Several experimental results for supercooled water can be understood in terms of the phase diagram we present.},

A rather complete map of hydration ([H2O]/[EO]) along the PEO chains has been detd. The hydration of the PEO regions is very low near the PEO/hydrocarbon interface in all phases and increases towards the outer region of the PEO shell with a gradient which becomes steeper in micellar phase in comparison with the lamellar phase. Temp. increase reduces the hydration levels at all measured sites. The order of the chains decreases by diln. from the lamellar to the micellar phase, but it is preserved within the frame of the lamellar phase at two different concns. The order degree, S, decreases in the series 5- > 7- > 10- > 12- > 16-doxyl, irresp. of temp., in all types of aggregates.

abstract = {MRI has provided significant clinical utility in the diagnosis of diseases and will become a powerful tool to assess phenotypic changes in genetically engineered animals. Overhauser enhanced MRI (OMRI), which is a double resonance technique, creates images of free radical distributions in small animals by enhancing the water proton signal intensity by means of the Overhauser effect. Several studies have demonstrated noninvasive assessment of reactive oxygen species generation in small animals by using low frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy/imaging and nitroxyl radicals. In vivo ESR signal intensities of nitroxyl radicals decrease with time after injection; and the decreases are enhanced by reactive oxygen species, generated in oxidative disease models in a site-specific manner. In this study, we show images of nitroxyl radicals with different isotopes by changing the external magnetic field for ESR irradiation between N-14 and N-15 nuclei in field-cycled OMRI. OMRI simultaneously obtained dual images of two individual chemical processes. Oxidation and reduction were monitored in a rate-dependent manner at nanometer scale by labeling membrane-permeable and -impermeable nitroxyl radicals with N-14 and N-15 nuclei. Phantom objects containing ascorbic acid-encapsulated liposomes with membrane-permeable radicals but not membrane-impermeable ones show a time-dependent decrease of the OMRI image intensity. The pharmacokinetics in mice was assessed with OMRI after radical administration. This OMRI technique with dual probes should offer significant applicability to nanometer scale molecular imaging and simultaneous assessment of independent processes in gene-modified animals. Thus, it may become a powerful tool to clarify mechanisms of disease and to monitor pharmaceutical therapy.},

abstract = {The behavior of the nitroxide spin labels 1-oxyl-4-bromo-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline (R5a) and 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline (R5) attached at a phosphorothioate-substituted site in a DNA duplex is modulated by the DNA in a site- and stereospecific manner. A better understanding of the mechanisms of R5a/R5 sensing of the DNA microenvironment will enhance our capability to relate information from nitroxide spectra to sequence-dependent properties of DNA. Toward this goal, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate R5 and R5a attached as R(p) and S(p) diastereomers at phosphorothioate (pS)C(7) of d(CTACTG(pS)C(7)Y(8)TTAG). d(CTAAAGCAGTAG) (Y = T or U). X-band continuous-wave EPR spectra revealed that the dT(8) to dU(8) change alters nanosecond rotational motions of R(p)-R5a but produces no detectable differences for S(p)-R5a, R(p)-R5, and S(p)-R5. MD simulations were able to qualitatively account for these spectral variations and provide a plausible physical basis for the R5/R5a behavior. The simulations also revealed a correlation between DNA backbone B(I)/B(II) conformations and R5/R5a rotational diffusion, thus suggesting a direct connection between DNA local backbone dynamics and EPR-detectable R5/R5a motion. These results advance our understanding of how a DNA microenvironment influences nitroxide motion and the observed EPR spectra. This may enable use of R5/R5a for a quantitative description of the sequence-dependent properties of large biologically relevant DNA molecules.},

abstract = {The translational hydration dynamics within 0.5-1.5 nm of the surface of a DPPC liposome, a model biomacromolecular surface, is analyzed by the recently developed Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP) technique. We find that dramatic changes to the bulk solvent cause only weak changes in the surface hydration dynamics. Specifically, both a >10-fold increase in bulk viscosity and the restriction of diffusion by confinement on a multiple nm length-scale change the local translational diffusion coefficient of the surface water surrounding the lipid bilayer by <2.5-fold. By contrast, previous ODNP studies have shown that changes to the biomacromolecular surface induced by folding, binding, or aggregation can cause local hydration dynamics to vary by factors of up to 30. We suggest that the surface topology and chemistry at the ≤1.5 nm scale, rather than the characteristics of the solvent, nearly exclusively determine the macromolecule's surface hydration dynamics.},

Optimal control enables efficient optimization of NMR experiments in terms of amplitudes, phases, offsets etc. for hundreds-to-thousands of pulses to fully exploit the experimentally available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat variations/limitations in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design procedures. This facilitates straightforward optimization of experiments under consideration of rf and static field inhomogeneities, limitations in available or desired rf field strengths (e.g., for reduction of sample heating), spread in resonance offsets or coupling parameters, variations in spin systems etc. to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as possible. The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the computational interface relevant for optimization of state-to-state transfer (on the density operator level) and the effective Hamiltonian on the level of propagators along with several representative examples within liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},

Control over the formation of CH(3)CO from (CH3)2CO, CF3 (or CH3) from CH3COCF3, and C6H5CH3 (toluene) from C6H5COCH3 was observed with high selectivity. Strong-field control appears to have generic applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored intense laser fields (about 10(13) watts per square centimeter) can dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently, the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found in the perturbative (weak-field) regime.},

abstract = {We have recently proposed a protocol for retrieving multidimensional magnetic resonance spectra and images within a single scan, based on a spatial encoding of the spin interactions. The spatial selectivity of this encoding process also opens up new possibilities for compensating magnetic field inhomogeneities; not by demanding extreme uniformities from the B(0) fields, but by compensating for their effects at an excitation and/or refocusing level. This potential is hereby discussed and demonstrated in connection with the single-scan acquisition of high-definition multidimensional images. It is shown that in combination with time-dependent gradient and radiofrequency manipulations, the new compensation approach can be used to counteract substantial field inhomogenities at either global or local levels over relatively long periods of time. The new compensation scheme could find uses in areas where heterogeneities in magnetic fields present serious obstacles, including rapid studies in regions near tissue/air interfaces. The principles of the B(0) compensation method are reviewed for one- and higher-dimensional cases, and experimentally demonstrated on a series of 1D and 2D single-scan MRI experiments on simple phantoms.},

abstract = {Frequency-swept pulses are not typically employed to excite spins in NMR. When used for selective excitation in MRI, such pulses do not produce a proper echo because the phase of the transverse magnetization varies in a quadratic manner across the slice or slab. Previously, frequency-swept pulses such as the chirp pulse have been shown to offer an approach to reduce the peak radiofrequency power required for excitation. It has also been shown that chirp excitation produces a unique type of echo (dubbed "pseudo-echo" here) and images can be generated from the resultant pseudo-echoes using a quadratic reconstruction method (J.G. Pipe, Magn Reson Med 1995;33:24-33). The present work describes a general theory and methods for exciting spins with other types of frequency-swept pulses (HSn pulses), which offer the advantage of delivering better excitation profiles than the chirp pulse. Here, pseudo-echoes are produced with HSn pulses in conventional gradient-echo 3D MRI, and high-quality images are reconstructed using standard fast Fourier transformation. An optional apodization procedure using a sliding window function is also introduced. When the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter is limiting, signal-to-noise ratio of pseudo-echo imaging is superior to that obtained with standard excitations.},

abstract = {Frequency-modulated (FM) pulses have practical advantages for spin-echo experiments, such as the ability to produce a broadband pi rotation, with an inhomogeneous radiofrequency (RF) field. However, such use leads to a nonlinear phase of the transverse magnetization, which is why FM pulses like the hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse are not commonly used for multislice spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, a general theory and methods are described for conventional spin-echo imaging using a pi HS pulse for refocusing. Phase profiles produced by the HS pulse are analytically described. The analysis is extended to yield the specific relationships between pulse parameters and gradients, which must be satisfied to compensate the nonlinear phase variation produced with a spin-echo sequence composed of pi/2 and pi HS pulses (the pi/2 HS - pi HS sequence). The latter offers advantages for multislice spin-echo MRI, including excellent slice-selection and partial compensation for RF inhomogeneity. Furthermore, it can be implemented with a shorter echo time and lower power deposition than a previously described method using a pair of pi HS pulses.},

The method is shown, for a solenoidal receiving coil, to give the same results as the traditional method of calculation, but its advantage lies in its ability to predict the ratio for other coil configurations. Particular attention is paid to the poor performance of a saddle-shaped (or Helmholtz) coil. Some of the practical problems involved are also discussed, including the error of matching the probe to the input impedance of the preamplifier.},

abstract = {Biological water at the interface of proteins is critical to their equilibrium structures and enzyme function and to phenomena such as molecular recognition and protein-protein interactions. To actually probe the dynamics of water structure at the surface, we must examine the protein itself, without disrupting the native structure, and the ultrafast elementary processes of hydration. Here we report direct study, with femtosecond resolution, of the dynamics of hydration at the surface of the enzyme protein Subtilisin Carlsberg, whose single Trp residue (Trp-113) was used as an intrinsic biological fluorescent probe. For the protein, we observed two well separated dynamical solvation times, 0.8 ps and 38 ps, whereas in bulk water, we obtained 180 fs and 1.1 ps. We also studied a covalently bonded probe at a separation of approximately 7 A and observed the near disappearance of the 38-ps component, with solvation being practically complete in (time constant) 1.5 ps. The degree of rigidity of the probe (anisotropy decay) and of the water environment (protein vs. micelle) was also studied. These results show that hydration at the surface is a dynamical process with two general types of trajectories, those that result from weak interactions with the selected surface site, giving rise to bulk-type solvation (approximately 1 ps), and those that have a stronger interaction, enough to define a rigid water structure, with a solvation time of 38 ps, much slower than that of the bulk. At a distance of approximately 7 A from the surface, essentially all trajectories are bulk-type. The theoretical framework for these observations is discussed.},

abstract = {We used the membrane-impermeable nitroxyl radical 4-trimethylammonium-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyliodide (CAT-1) as a model drug encapsulated in liposomes in order to separately map the 2D distribution of both liposomal-encapsulated CAT-1 and free CAT-1. Phantoms were prepared with a CAT-1 solution and a liposomal CAT-1 suspension. Spectral-spatial images were obtained along several polar-arranged spatial axes through the phantom. The 1D spatial distributions (projections) of each signal component, reflecting the concentration of CAT-1, were then extracted from the spectral-spatial images. 2D EPR images of liposomal-encapsulated CAT-1 and free CAT-1 were separately reconstructed from the resulting projection data sets. 2D mapping of each component exhibited good agreement with respect to the phantom. Separate maps were generated from separate injections of free CAT-1 and liposomal CAT-1 injected into the femoral muscle of a living mouse. The EPR signal of the free CAT-1 gradually decreased during data acquisition. Because of this decay, we calibrated the image intensity by extrapolating the signal intensity to that detected at the beginning of data sampling. Both the position and size of the individual images were in very good agreement with those of the mouse thigh obtained by MRI.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: An innovative, noninvasive, low-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy method was applied and adapted to investigate the integrity of multilamellar liposomes from hydrogenated phospholipids after subcutaneous injection in living mice. Moreover, the fate of the injected liposomal preparations was examined, as well as the possibility to achieve a depot effect. METHODS: Highly concentrated solutions of the spin probe 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-trimethylammoniumpiperidine-1-oxyl-iodide (CAT-1; 138 mM) were encapsulated in liposomes. They were characterized by laser diffraction, and the liberation of spin probe was investigated by ESR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Line shape changes allowed the differentiation between encapsulated and released CAT-1 after subcutaneous injection of liposomes. Multilamellar liposomes form a local depot at the site of injection. A sustained release of the spin probe from the depot was monitored by means of ESR. Whereas 40\% of the spin probe was released within the first 96 h after administration, 60\% remained in intact liposomes under the skin. No depot formation could be observed after injection of CAT-1 solutions, but a fast signal decrease due to systemic distribution and bioreduction of the nitroxide spin probe. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive analysis of liposomal integrity in living animals was successfully accomplished using a new L-Band ESR spectroscopy method. The liberation of CAT-1 from liposomes in vitro and in vivo was monitored by changes in the lineshape of ESR spectra and Heisenberg spin exchange. The significance of liposomal integrity for the formation of a localized drug depot effect was proved.},

abstract = {Water-soluble spin labels were used to study dimyristoyllecithin (DML) phospholipid multilayers. Previous studies report that there is a "bound" water region associated with dimyristoyllecithin containing about 10 molecules of water per phospholipid, a "trapped" water region located between the lamellae containing approximately 11 molecules per phospholipid, and a "ftion show that certain water-soluble spin-label mol-cules have their motional properties differentially modified by these three water environements. Furthermore, the labels also reveal the onset of lipid-phase transitions even though they have high water solubility. A phosphate-containing spin label demonstrated strong an isotropic motion in the lipid-water system above the phase transition but not below. The addition of cholesterol to the DML-water system removed the anisotropic motion of 2,2,6,6-tetramehtyl-4-phosphopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempophosphate) and obscured the detection bound, trapped, and free water. In addition to the change-charge interactions between Tempophosphate and DML, two other spin labels were used both in the charged and uncharged states. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidine-N-oxyl (Tempamine) in the charged state showed extremely strong anisotropic motion, presumably due to the interaction between the charged amine and the phosphate group of DML. When only partially charged, Tempamine showed much less anisotropic motion. PCA was analyzed at pH values where the carboxyl group was protonated and unprotonated. The resulting interaction was different at the two pH values. These water-soluble spin labels mimic ionic or nonionic solutes. Upon freezing, the spin labels are shown to be expelled from the ice regions into the remaining aqueous regions. The usefulness of this approach in studying solute behavior when freezing occurs and potential studies involving aqueous regions of cytoplasm are considered.},

Results obtained in DRCOSY experiments show that the diffusion process of dextran 77 kDa exhibits an observation time dependence suggesting a diffusion behavior restricted by confinement. We find evidence for both single capsule and capsule aggregate states, with a partitioning of the 77-kDa dextran between the free and capsule states much larger than that suggested by volume fraction alone. Results from DEXSY experiments show that dextran 77 kDa is in diffusive exchange through the capsules with an exchange time of around 1 s. In contrast, the capsules have no detectable influence on the diffusion process of the dextran 4.4 kDa. This quantitative information may be used in designing PEM capsules as drug carriers.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The influence of liposome composition on the bilayer fluidity and on the transport of encapsulated substance into the skin was investigated. METHODS: Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with various amounts of cholesterol were prepared by the film method and characterised by photon correlation spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. The transport of the hydrophilic spin probe encapsulated in MLV into pig ear skin was investigated by EPR imaging methods. The bilayer domain structure was studied by fitting the lineshape of the experimental EPR spectra with the spectra calculated by the model, which takes into account the heterogeneous structure of the bilayer with several coexisting domains. RESULTS: Cholesterol strongly influences the entrapped volume of liposomes, the domain structure of the lipid bilayer, and the transport of hydrophilic spin probe into the skin. Transport was not observed for liposomes composed of phospholipid:cholesterol 1:0 or 9:1 (mol:mol), not even above the phase transition temperature from the gel to the liquid crystalline phase of DMPC. A significant delivery of hydrophilic spin probe was observed only if there was 30 or 50 mol\% of cholesterol in the liposome bilayer. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the domain structure of the liposome bilayer is more important for the delivery of encapsulated substance into the skin than the liquid crystalline phase of the pure phospholipids bilayer.},

This has been shown by many investigations carried out with a variety of enzymes. A review of these studies is given and some of the main results are summarized. With respect to the vesicle-forming amphiphiles used, most preparations are based on phosphatidylcholine, either the natural mixtures obtained from soybean or egg yolk, or chemically defined compounds, such as DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) or POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Charged enzyme-containing lipid vesicles are often prepared by adding a certain amount of a negatively charged amphiphile (typically dicetylphosphate) or a positively charged lipid (usually stearylamine). The presence of charges in the vesicle membrane may lead to an adsorption of the enzyme onto the interior or exterior site of the vesicle bilayers. If (i) the high enzyme encapsulation efficiencies; (ii) avoidance of the use of organic solvents during the entrapment procedure; (iii) relatively monodisperse spherical vesicles of about 100 nm diameter; and (iv) a high degree of unilamellarity are required, then the use of the so-called 'dehydration-rehydration method', followed by the 'extrusion technique' has shown to be superior over other procedures. In addition to many investigations in the field of cheese production--there are several studies on the (potential) medical and biomedical applications of enzyme-containing lipid vesicles (e.g. in the enzyme-replacement therapy or for immunoassays)--including a few in vivo studies. In many cases, the enzyme molecules are expected to be released from the vesicles at the target site, and the vesicles in these cases serve as the carrier system. For (potential) medical applications as enzyme carriers in the blood circulation, the preparation of sterically stabilized lipid vesicles has proven to be advantageous. Regarding the use of enzyme-containing vesicles as submicrometer-sized nanoreactors, substrates are added to the bulk phase. Upon permeation across the vesicle bilayer(s), the trapped enzymes inside the vesicles catalyze the conversion of the substrate molecules into products. Using physical (e.g. microwave irradiation) or chemical methods (e.g. addition of micelle-forming amphiphiles at sublytic concentration), the bilayer permeability can be controlled to a certain extent. A detailed molecular understanding of these (usually) submicrometer-sized bioreactor systems is still not there. There are only a few approaches towards a deeper understanding and modeling of the catalytic activity of the entrapped enzyme molecules upon externally added substrates. Using micrometer-sized vesicles (so-called 'giant vesicles') as simple models for the lipidic matrix of biological cells, enzyme molecules can be microinjected inside individual target vesicles, and the corresponding enzymatic reaction can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy using appropriate fluorogenic substrate molecules.},

abstract = {Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

abstract = {The function of many proteins involves equilibria between conformational substates, and to elucidate mechanisms of function it is essential to have experimental tools to detect the presence of conformational substates and to determine the time scale of exchange between them. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) has the potential to serve this purpose. In proteins containing a nitroxide side chain (R1), multicomponent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra can arise either from equilibria involving different conformational substates or rotamers of R1. To employ SDSL to uniquely identify conformational equilibria, it is thus essential to distinguish between these origins of multicomponent spectra. Here we show that this is possible based on the time scale for exchange of the nitroxide between distinct environments that give rise to multicomponent EPR spectra; rotamer exchange for R1 lies in the ≈0.1-1 $\mu$s range, while conformational exchange is at least an order of magnitude slower. The time scales of exchange events are determined by saturation recovery EPR, and in favorable cases, the exchange rate constants between substates with lifetimes of approximately 1-70 $\mu$s can be estimated by the approach.},

abstract = {Stochastic excitation with a full-width-half-maximum bandwidth of 250 MHz was used to perform Fourier-transform (FT) high-field/high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at 3.4T/95 GHz (W-band). Thereby, the required microwave peak power is reduced by a factor of tau(p)/T1 as compared to equivalent pulsed FT EPR in which the spin system with spin-lattice relaxation time T1 is excited by a single microwave pulse of length tau(p). Stochastic EPR is particularly interesting under high-field/high-frequency conditions, because the limited output power of mm microwave sources, amplifiers, and mixers makes pulse FT EPR in that frequency domain impossible, at least for the near future. On the other hand, FT spectroscopy offers several advantages compared to field-swept magnetic resonance methods, as is demonstrated by its success in NMR and X-band EPR. In this paper we describe a novel stochastic W-band microwave bridge including a bimodal induction mode transmission resonator that serves for decoupling the microwave excitation and signal detection. We report first EPR measurements and discuss experimental difficulties as well as achieved sensitivity. Moreover, we discuss future improvements and the possibility for an application of stochastic W-band FT EPR to transient signals such as those of photoexcited radical pairs in photosynthetic reaction centers.},

However, in many cases more than one paramagnetic species is contributing to the observed EPR spectrum, making the analysis of individual contributions difficult and in some cases impossible. With time-domain techniques it is possible to exploit differences in the relaxation behavior of different paramagnetic species to distinguish between them and separate their individual spectral contribution. Here we give an overview of the use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). While FeS cluster N1 can be studied individually at a temperature of 30 K, this is not possible for FeS cluster N2 due to its severe spectral overlap with cluster N1. In this case Relaxation Filtered Hyperfine (REFINE) spectroscopy can be used to separate the overlapping spectra based on differences in their relaxation behavior.},

The considerable enhancement this experiment provides for extracting rotational and translational diffusion rates, as well as orientational ordering parameters by means of ESR spectroscopy, is demonstrated. The 2D spectral analysis is achieved using theoretical simulations that are fit to experiments by an efficient and automated nonlinear least squares approach. These methods are applied to dispersions of 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (POPC) model membranes utilizing spin labels 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylcholine and the 3-doxyl derivative of cholestan-3-one (CSL). Generally favorable agreement is obtained between the results obtained by 2D-FT-ESR on vesicles with the previous results on similar systems studied by continuous wave (cw) ESR on aligned samples. The precision in determining the dynamic and ordering parameters is significantly better for 2D-FT-ESR, even though the cw ESR spectra from membrane vesicles are resolved more poorly than those from well aligned samples. Some small differences in results by the two methods are discussed in terms of limitations of the methods and/or theoretical models, as well as possible differences between dynamic molecular structure in vesicles versus aligned membranes. An interesting observation with CSL/POPC, that the apparent homogeneous linewidths seem to increase in "real time," is tentatively attributed to the effects of slow director fluctuations in the membrane vesicles.},

abstract = {New electron spin resonance (ESR) technologies have been developed, which have led to new and improved applications. (a) The development of two-dimensional Fourier transform (FT) ESR required spectrometers providing intense pi/2 microwave pulses of very short (3-5 ns) duration, wide bandwidths, and very short dead times. It has enabled studies that resolve sophisticated details of molecular dynamics in complex fluids. (b) Methods that produce multiple quantum coherences by pulsed ESR now enable accurate measurements of large distances (>12A). (c) One of the most important advances has been the extension of ESR to high magnetic fields and high frequencies. This has benefited from the utilization of quasi-optical methods, especially above 150 GHz. The greatly improved orientational resolution and the faster "snapshot" of motions that are provided by ESR at high frequencies enhance studies of molecular dynamics. The use of both high and lower frequencies enables one to unravel faster and slower modes from the complex dynamics of fluids and macromolecules. (d) The development of FT-ESR imaging required substantial pulsed field gradients lasting only 50-100 ns. ESR imaging is effective in studying diffusion in fluids.

abstract = {Short-pulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxide-labeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions. Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used. Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials. The time constants contain various combinations of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1e) for both isotopes, Heisenberg exchange rates, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times (T1n). Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants. The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that (i) the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number, (ii) relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition, (iii) the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length, (iv) T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration, and (v) Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration. It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here. The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spin-lattice relaxation probabilities.},

A commercial waveform generator was integrated with the transmit arm of the existing time-domain RF-EPR spectrometer to generate tailored excitation pulses with sub-nano second resolution for excitation with a 90 degrees flip-angle. A truncated sinc [sin(x)/x] pulse, tailored to compensate for the Q-profile (RF frequency response) of the resonator, was shown to yield images from phantom objects as well as in vivo images, with minimal distortion. These studies point to the advantages in using shaped sinc pulses to achieve improved uniform excitation over a relatively wide bandwidth region in time-domain RF-EPR imaging (RF-FT-EPRI).},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy provides a variety of tools to study structures and structural changes of large biomolecules or complexes thereof. In order to unravel secondary structure elements, domain arrangements or complex formation, continuous wave and pulsed EPR methods capable of measuring the magnetic dipole coupling between two unpaired electrons can be used to obtain long-range distance constraints on the nanometer scale. Such methods yield reliably and precisely distances of up to 80 A, can be applied to biomolecules in aqueous buffer solutions or membranes, and are not size limited. They can be applied either at cryogenic or physiological temperatures and down to amounts of a few nanomoles. Spin centers may be metal ions, metal clusters, cofactor radicals, amino acid radicals, or spin labels. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the different EPR spectroscopic methods, briefly describe their theoretical background, and summarize important biological applications. The main focus of this article will be on pulsed EPR methods like pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) and their applications to spin-labeled biosystems.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional Fourier Transform ESR (2D FT ESR) spectrometer operating at 9.25 and 17.35 GHz is described. The Ku-band bridge uses an efficient heterodyne technique wherein 9.25 GHz is the intermediate frequency. At Ku-band the sensitivity is increased by almost an order of magnitude. One may routinely collect a full 2D ELDOR spectrum in less than 20 min for a sample containing 0.5-5 nmol of nitroxide spin-probe in the slow-motional regime. Broad spectral coverage at Ku-band is obtained by use of a bridged loop-gap resonator (BLGR) and of a dielectric ring resonator (DR). It is shown that an even more uniform spectral excitation is obtained by using shorter microwave pulses of about 3 ns duration. The dead-time at Ku-band is just 30-40 ns, yielding an improved SNR in 2D ELDOR spectra of nitroxide spin-probes with T2 as short as 20-30 ns. A comparison of 2D ELDOR spectra obtained at 9.25 and 17. 35 GHz for spin-labeled phospholipid probes (16PC) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) membrane vesicles showed that both spectra could be satisfactorily simulated using the same set of model parameters even though they are markedly different in appearance. The improved sensitivity and shorter dead-time at Ku-band made it possible to obtain orientation-dependent 2D ELDOR spectra of the Cholestane (CSL) spin-probe in macroscopically aligned lipid bilayers of egg yolk PC using samples containing only 1 mg of lipid and just 5 nmol of spin-probe.},

With the new pulse sequence electron-electron couplings can be studied without dead-time artifacts, so that even broad distributions of electron-electron distances can be characterized. A version of the experiment that uses a pulse train in the detection period exhibits improved signal-to-noise ratio. Tests on two nitroxide biradicals with known length indicate that the accessible range of distances extends from about 1.5 to 8 nm. The four-pulse DEER spectra of an ionic spin probe in an ionomer exhibit features due to probe molecules situated both on the same and on different ion clusters. The former feature provides information on the cluster size and is inaccessible with previous methods.},

abstract = {There are no easily obtainable EPR spectral parameters for lipid spin labels that describe profiles of membrane fluidity. The order parameter, which is most often used as a measure of membrane fluidity, describes the amplitude of wobbling motion of alkyl chains relative to the membrane normal and does not contain explicitly time or velocity. Thus, this parameter can be considered as nondynamic. The spin-lattice relaxation rate (T(1)(-1)) obtained from saturation-recovery EPR measurements of lipid spin labels in deoxygenated samples depends primarily on the rotational correlation time of the nitroxide moiety within the lipid bilayer. Thus, T(1)(-1) can be used as a convenient quantitative measure of membrane fluidity that reflects local membrane dynamics. T(1)(-1) profiles obtained for 1-palmitoyl-2-(n-doxylstearoyl)phosphatidylcholine (n-PC) spin labels in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membranes with and without 50 mol\% cholesterol are presented in parallel with profiles of the rotational diffusion coefficient, R(⊥), obtained from simulation of EPR spectra using Freed's model. These profiles are compared with profiles of the order parameter obtained directly from EPR spectra and with profiles of the order parameter obtained from simulation of EPR spectra. It is shown that T(1)(-1) and R(⊥) profiles reveal changes in membrane fluidity that depend on the motional properties of the lipid alkyl chain. We find that cholesterol has a rigidifying effect only to the depth occupied by the rigid steroid ring structure and a fluidizing effect at deeper locations. These effects cannot be differentiated by profiles of the order parameter. All profiles in this study were obtained at X-band (9.5 GHz).},

abstract = {Long pulse saturation recovery electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is applied to the investigation of spin-labeled side chains placed along a regular helix extending from 128 to 135 in T4 lysozyme. Under an argon atmosphere, analysis of the exponential saturation recovery curves gives the spin-lattice relaxation rates of the nitroxides, which depend on the nitroxide side-chain dynamics. In the presence of the fast-relaxing paramagnetic reagents O(2) or NiEDDA, global analysis of the saturation recovery provides the spin-lattice relaxation rates as well as the Heisenberg exchange rates of the nitroxide with the reagents. As previously shown with power saturation methods, such exchange rates are direct measures of the solvent accessibility of the nitroxide side chains in the protein structure. The periodic dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates and the exchange rates along the 128-135 sequence reveal the presence of the helical structure, demonstrating the use of these parameters in structure determination. In general, multiple exponentials are required to fit the saturation recovery data, thus identifying multiple states of the side chain. In one case, multiple conformations detected in the spectrum are not evident in the saturation recovery, suggesting rapid exchange on the timescale of spin-lattice relaxation.},

abstract = {Saturation-recovery (SR) EPR at W-band (94 GHz) to obtain profiles of the membrane fluidity and profiles of the oxygen transport parameter is demonstrated for lens lipid membranes using phosphatidylcholine (n-PC), stearic acid (n-SASL), and cholesterol analog (ASL and CSL) spin labels, and compared with results obtained in parallel experiments at X-band (9.4 GHz). Membranes were derived from the total lipids extracted from 2-year-old porcine lens cortex and nucleus. Two findings are especially significant. First, measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation times T1 for n-PCs allowed T1 profiles across the membrane to be obtained. These profiles reflect local membrane properties differently than profiles of the order parameter. Profiles obtained at W-band are, however, shifted to longer T1 values compared to those obtained at X-band. Second, using cholesterol analog spin labels and relaxation agents (hydrophobic oxygen and water-soluble NiEDDA), the cholesterol bilayer domain was discriminated in membranes made from lipids of the lens nucleus. However, membranes made from cortical lipids show a single homogeneous environment. Profiles of the oxygen transport parameter obtained from W-band measurements are practically identical to those obtained from X-band measurements, and are very similar to those obtained earlier at X-band for membranes made of 2-year-old bovine cortical and nuclear lens lipids (M. Raguz, J. Widomska, J. Dillon, E.R. Gaillard, W.K. Subczynski, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1788 (2009) 2380-2388). Results demonstrate that SR EPR at W-band has the potential to be a powerful tool for studying samples of small volume, ∼30 nL, compared with the sample volume of ∼3 $\mu$L at X-band.},
