(This is an introduction.  For detailed info, see :class:`API documentation <pyspecdata.nddata>`.)

The nddata class is built on top of numpy_.
Numpy allows you to create multi-dimensional arrays of data.
The nddata class labels the dimensions (with a short text identifier)
and allows you to associate
axes, units, and errors with the data.
These attributes
*are correctly transformed* when you perform arithmetic operations
or Fourier transforms,
and are used to automatically format plots.

Below, we outline how you can use
dimension labels to make code more legible and make many common tasks easier.
Then, we note how slicing operations are different (and easier) for nddata than for standard numpy arrays.
Finally, we outline several classes of methods by sub-topic.

Dimension labels
----------------

All dimension labels can have a display name (used for printing and plotting)
and one or more short names (used for writing code).

You don't need to keep track of the order of dimensions or align dimensions
during multiplication.
When you do arithmetic with two arrays,
pyspecdata will first reshape the arrays
so that dimensions with the same names are aligned with each other.
Furthermore,
during an arithmetic operation,
if a dimension is present in one array
but not the other,
pyspecdata will simply tile the smaller array along the missing dimension(s).

To see how this works, compare the results of

>>> a = nddata(r_[0:4],'a')
>>> b = nddata(r_[0:4],'a')
>>> a*b
[0, 1, 4, 9]
                +/-None
        dimlabels=['a']
        axes={`a':[0, 1, 2, 3]
                        +/-None}

which are arrays of data organized along the *same* dimension,
and

>>> a = nddata(r_[0:4],'a')
>>> b = nddata(r_[0:4],'b')
>>> print a*b
[[0, 0, 0, 0]
 [0, 1, 2, 3]
 [0, 2, 4, 6]
 [0, 3, 6, 9]]
                +/-None
        dimlabels=['a', 'b']
        axes={`a':[0, 1, 2, 3]
                        +/-None,
                `b':[0, 1, 2, 3]
                        +/-None}

which are arrays of data organized along two *different* dimensions.

You can refer to a time dimension, such as `t1`, `t_1`, `t_direct`, *etc.*
as `f1`, `f_1`, *etc.* in order to retrieve the Fourier transform.
You can set the pairs ...

.. warning::
    error propagation for trig functions doesn't yet work;
    automatic t *vs.* f naming not yet implemented.

Item selection and slicing
--------------------------

Pyspecdata offers several different synataxes 
for item selection and slicing
that can be used to select subsets of the data,
and which are outlined below.
These can be combined in a single square bracket, separated by commas.

Numpy Index Slicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Slice by Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Axis Value
~~~~~~~~~~

To pull a single point along a particular dimension,
you can just use the value of the axis.
The point nearest to the axis will be returned.

>>> d['t2':1.1]

Will return the point (or slice of data) where the t2 axis is closest to 1.1 s.

Axis Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify an inclusive range of numbers along an axis.
For example, to select from 0 to 100 Î¼s along `t2`, you use:

>>> d['t2':(0,100e-6)]

Either value in parentheses can be `None`, in which case, all values to the end of the axis will be selected.

Logical
~~~~~~~

You can use functions that return logical values to select

>>> d[lambda x: abs(x-2)<5]

>>> d['t2',lambda x: abs(x-2)<5]

When this is done, nddata will check to see if slices along any dimension are uniformly missing.
If they are, the dataset will be trimmed to remove them.

When the deselected data are scattered throughout, a mask is used instead.

Fourier domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    this feature is planned, not yet implemented.

>>> d['f2':(-1e6,1e6)]

switches to the frequency dimension (shift by default -- shift should be a property)

Methods by Sub-Topic
--------------------

It's important to note that, in contrast to standard numpy,
    nddata routines are designed to be called as methods,
    rather than independent functions.
Also, these methods **modify the data in-place** rather than returning a copy.
For example, after executing
``d.ft('t2')``, the object ``d`` will contain the *Fourier transformed* data.
There is not need to assign the result to a new variable.
Alternatively, the property ``C`` offers easy access to a copy:
``a = d.C.ft('t2')`` leaves ``d`` alone, and returns the FT as a new object
called ``a``.

This encourages a style where methods are chained together, *e.g.* ``d.ft('t2').mean('t1')``.

A selection of the methods noted below are broken down by sub-topic.
